Our trip was organized by the guesthouse Koimala Hotel .  The boat in which we went in search of a whale shark also belongs to this guesthouse .  The boat is run by the employees of this hotel .  On this day we were lucky with the weather .  The sun was shining brightly ,  a gentle wind was blowing and the Indian Ocean was calm .  Our trip lasted about 3 hours .  We three times jumped into the water to look at the Whale Shark ,  but Ira and I only once  ( and not for very long )  saw the blurred shadow of the Whale Shark at depth .  In the second part of the video hit the moment when in the bottom of the place gathered boats and boats .  If you look around ,  you can count them up to a dozen . nChannel #TaksaTravels In Search of a Whale Shark . n--------nREST MALDIVA 2018 INDEPENDENTLY https: /  / www . youtube . com / playlist ? list=PLalvdWvkzTWArcV818FSxv_gaZRuRU-wCnnPOWER SUPPLY  ( FOOD )  MALDIVA 2018 INDEPENDENTLY https: /  / www . youtube . com / playlist ? list=PLalvdWvkzTWATh5jQvngYqzER2iOrgtxpnnMALDIVES 2018 REST FOR TWO https: /  / www . youtube . com / playlist ? list=PLalvdWvkzTWBrFMTUYzjSOBBVKZLni0qknnMAAFUSHI ISLAND 2018 MALDIVES INDEPENDENTLY https: /  / www . youtube . com / playlist ? list=PLalvdWvkzTWDBkm_UUrUlXicEpouBMfDdnnISLAND HULHUMALE 2018 MALDIVES INDEPENDENTLY https: /  / www . youtube . com / playlist ? list=PLalvdWvkzTWB2I763Z_xbNN4IjtXZZitfnnISLAND MAMIGILEY 2018 MALDIVES INDEPENDENTLY https: /  / www . youtube . com / playlist ? list=PLalvdWvkzTWCC60VJNBIDUSlVHHBl1FaznnISLAND GURAYDO 2018 MALDIVES INDEPENDENTLY https: /  / www . youtube . com / playlist ? list=PLalvdWvkzTWCX_1BMbpYETuap2oaeCEnknnISLAND OF THE DISTRIBUTION 2018 MALDIVES INDEPENDENTLY https: /  / www . youtube . com / playlist ? list=PLalvdWvkzTWDCEFDR32JVEE-3znk-uSx7nnMALE CITY 2018 MALDIVES INDEPENDENTLY https: /  / www . youtube . com / playlist ? list=PLalvdWvkzTWCXdLcCBElE9qeaLJ9Fx-QwnnMALDIVES 2018 HEART ON EARTH https: /  / www . youtube . com / playlist ? list=PLalvdWvkzTWAoch8vugsEpvQARpEVmNzwnnOur channel: TaksaTravels - Dmitry and Irina https: /  / www . youtube . com / channel / UCB8aK4tCxZnj9SMyG1Lj4Tg [u043Cu0430u043Bu044Cu0434u0438u0432u044B , Maldives , u0432u0438u0434u0435u043E 360 u0433u0440u0430u0434u0443u0441u043Eu0432 , video 360 degrees

__label__good divers swim through hammerheads to meet huge whale shark whale sharks are the largest known fish in the ocean .  with the exception of some whale species  they are the largest animals on earth .  although we know very little about them  we do know that they can reach a length of 55 feet or more and can live to over 70 years of age .  the weight of a full grown whale shark is estimated to be approximately 50 000 pounds .  roughly the size of a school bus  they dwarf even the largest great white sharks .  they are gentle and slow moving giants that feed on plankton  krill  small fish  fish eggs and crab larvae .  although they have enormous mouths  they are filter feeders and incapable of posing a threat to humans or any other large animals .  they follow ocean currents to feed  populating all tropical seas .  with one of the most distinctive skin patterns in the animal kingdom  they are easily recognizable .  their spots are as unique as the fingerprints of humans .  no two whale sharks are exactly alike .  scuba divers consider whale shark sightings to be one of the most sought after experiences .  for most  it is the ultimate thrill  and swimming alongside one for more than a moment is likely to be one of lifeu2019s most memorable events .  these divers have traveled to darwin island  the most famous of the galapagos islands  hopeful to see a whale shark .  the galapagos are one of the most diverse and remarkable areas on our planet .  the environment is hostile and beautiful at the same time  and because three great currents converge around them  the habitat produces a food supply that attracts hammerhead sharks  galapagos sharks  sea turtles  dolphins  and more pregnant female whale sharks than most other areas of the world .  researchers donu2019t know where they go to have their young but they do know that almost 100 per cent of whale sharks sighted here are mothers carrying babies .  scuba divers make a rapid descent to the rocky bottom  eager to find shelter from the powerful currents that could sweep them away .  they perch themselves on rocky ledges and peer out into the vast blue  waiting for that moment when one of these beautiful beasts will appear in front of them .  the ledge around darwinu2019s arch is aptly named u201Cthe theatreu201D and the show is a live performance that rivals any imax experience .  the divers watch as schools of fish and large hammerhead sharks cruise past  along with occasional turtles and a few other shark species .  the appearance of a whale shark is uncertain and often they are only seen from a distance .  the dive guide will keep one eye on the group and the other on the depths beyond .  if he sees a whale shark  he will signal the group by rattling a small shaker and he will point in the direction that they need to go .  they quickly add air to their buoyancy vests and head into the blue to meet the shark and get a closer look .  this large female whale shark is approximately 50 feet long and is carrying young .  with a slow approach  divers were able to swim alongside her at a depth of about 60 feet .  she calmly swept her tail back and forth  effortlessly maintaining a pace that a diver must work hard to match .  if she becomes concerned  a few powerful sweeps of her massive tail will propel her out of reach in seconds .  she is also capable of descending quickly to retreat from a threat .  whale sharks are often accepting  even curious  when they encounter scuba divers .  a close encounter such as this one is something that very few divers will ever experience and it was a dive that these lucky people will never forget .  the guides and crew of the galapagos sky and float u2018nu2019 flag dive shop provided this group with exceptional memories that will be cherished forever .

__label__poor Large wave drenches tourist trying to get video of whales The Galapagos Sky is a small cruise ship that takes 16 tourists on a remote and incredible adventure to the outermost reaches around the Galapagos Islands .  Embarking on a dive adventure that would lead them to Wolf and Darwin Islands to meet hammerhead sharks and whale sharks ,  these tourists were watching the beautiful scenery and catching an occasional glimpse of pilot whales and fin whales .  One brave Canadian tourist decided to wander up front ,  despite the waves ,  to try to capture a whale breach on video .  What he caught instead was the slap of a large wave that came crashing over the bow .  Quickly deciding that the lower deck wasnt the best place to be in rough seas ,  he made a hasty retreat .  He couldnt help but laugh when he realized that the boat captain had been able to see the whole episode from the bridge ,  and he was laughing even harder .  The two of them had a very different perspective on the same event .  As an afterthought ,  he can be seen checking that the camera is still working to make sure the salt water hasnt wrecked it .  Our Canadian friend also had some explaining to do when he went back inside the ship ,  dripping wet to join the other tourists .  The Galapagos Sky is an amazing ship ,  with a crew that prides themselves on service that is beyond anybodys expectations .  The one week tour took these adventurous scuba divers to one of the most remote ,  hostile ,  and beautiful places on the planet .  Several BBC series have been produced that describe this magical and unforgiving world .  As a dive destination ,  it is second to none .  These guests saw unique birds ,  marine iguanas ,  several different species of sharks ,  and the most sought after creature of all ,  the magnificent whale shark .  Their trip to this remote paradise was truly the adventure of a lifetime . nnSource & embed code: https: /  / rumble . com / v75ht4-boat-wav-completely-drenches-tourist . html . nnFor licensing ,  please email licensing@rumble . com .

__label__poor top 5 dinosaur fights and prehistory  which really happened .  top 5 dinosaur fights and prehistory  which really happened . nsummary: the dinosaurs are considered as titanic monsters who once trod the earth .  but just as in nature  the atmosphere of prehistory  it was a war zone .  where fighting and struggling to survive  was the daily bread .  from clashes between carnivorous and herbivorous dinosaurs  to fights in the sea  by territory .  on this occasion  we will review those dinosaur fights and other great rivalries of prehistory that really happened . nnnnumber 5: spinosaurus vs carcharodontosaurus . nin the 2008  a spinosaurus vertebra was found fractured .  no one knew that animal would be able to inflict such damage on him .  later on  the bbc paleontologists said that this fracture was caused by a carchadontosaurus .  these two dinosaurs usually would not have met  but when the drought affected the environment in which they lived  these carnivores faced more than once  fighting for food . nnnumber 4: titanoboa vs carbonemis . nncolombia  60 million years ago .  this was the scene of a fight of superpredators .  on the one hand  we have the biggest snake known .  .  .  the titanoboa .  this snake  on many occasions was disputed its territory with a tortoise that was just as giant .  .  .  the carbonemys turtle .  paleontologists from the university of north carolina claim that this tortoise had a bite so potent that allowed him to defend himself from predators  and even confront them if necessary .  although there is no evidence that the titanoboa and this tortoise have clashed .  what we do know is that both fossils were found in the same area . nnnumber 3: t-rex vs triceratops . nnthe tyrannosaurus rex is known for being one of the most ruthless predators in the cretaceous .  it is known that he fed on any living being that crossed his path . nhowever  there is a prey  which was not so easy to hunt .  and it is nothing more and nothing less than the triceratops . ntyrannosauruss bite marks on the fossils of triceratops indicate that these two dinosaurs were always struggling for their survival .  many times this struggle has been portrayed in popular culture  both in films and in exhibitions .  having the tyrannosaurus some victories and some defeats . nwithout a doubt  these two dinosaurs converted the cretaceous period into a battlefield for survival . nnnumber 2: bear of the caverns vs .  american lion . nnthe confrontation between the lion of the caverns and the bear of the caverns .  the lion of the caverns  named thus  because several of his bones were found in the caverns .  although it is doubtful that these lions have lived there .  hence  there is a hypothesis that these lions  could have ventured into these caverns  in search of bears for their augmentation .  but because the cave bear  was a giant that reached a height of 1 . 3 meters  many scientists think that the lion attacked them when they were still hibernating . nnnumber 1: gigantosaurus vs argentinosaurus . nnthere is evidence  that these true titans of prehistory have clashed .  on the one hand  the argentinosaurus  a dinosaur with an approximate size of 33 meters in length  and the other  the gigantosaurus  a carnivorous 13 meters long .  it has been speculated that the gigantosaurus  on many occasions hunted these great animals .  but to do so  the gigantosaurus resorted to the group attacks  causing real struggles for survival . nnnnnground zero: megalodon vs livyathan melvillei . nnthe competition for food in the miocene sea .  the miocene  was the time when there were two giant predators .  on one hand the megalodon and the other the lyviathan melivillei  a prehistoric killer whale .  these two predators always vied for food in the miocene sea . nit has been said that his constant struggle for food caused one of them to move from his place of home  and then possibly become extinct . ntoday  killer whales are known to kill large sharks .  would it be that this was also the prehistory ? nthinking about dinosaur fights and prehistoric struggles is a fascinating topic .  we cant know if it really happened .  but what we do know is that prehistory was not a paradise . nnpowered by: http: /  / swordlord3d . deviantart . com material used in this video: music and effects here: http: /  / bit . ly / 2meqfmw animations and videos here: http: /  / bit . ly / 2oakqsz you never know what you can find here  so follow me: facebook: bit . ly / 2aj1v6p [dinosaur fights  rex dinosaur fights  prehistoric animal fights  spinosaurus  t-rex  carnivores dinosaurs  spinosaurus vs carcharodontosaurus  t-rex vs triceratops  giganotosaurus  megalodon  livyathan   livyathan melvillei vs megalodon   bear of the caverns   lion of the caverns   cave bear vs .  american lion   dinosaurs   prehistory   documentaries   top 5   minidocumentales   topman   documentaries in spanish   dinosaur videos

__label__good scuba diver scrambles to avoid whale sharks approaching tail divers in the galapagos islands had the incredible experience of meeting a massive whale shark up close .  the giant beast is almost 50 feet long and could weigh as much as 100 000 pounds .  they are the biggest fish in the ocean and  aside from some whale species  the largest animal in the world .  divers wait a lifetime to catch a glimpse of these majestic creatures and some dare to dream of capturing a picture or video of them .  for almost all scuba divers  this is the ultimate underwater experience .  despite their enormous size  they are the gentlest souls in the ocean and will never harm a human .  most encounters are brief  as whale sharks dont often seek interaction with people .  they will veer away  or even dive deep if they are concerned .  a few sweeps of their massive tail will carry them quickly to safety .  but this particular whale shark seemed mildly curious about the divers .  she is a large female  carrying young that will be born soon .  she approached a group of divers and swam slowly through the middle of them  giving them an arms length encounter that none of them will ever forget .  as if wanting to get her own look at them  she arced gracefully  curving past several and allowing some a second look .  kristy couldnt resist the once in a lifetime opportunity and began snapping photographs as the whale shark circled below her .  drifting in the strong current  kristy found herself directly over the sharks back only a few feet from it .  respectful divers will not touch marine life  especially a whale shark  and they try to avoid accidental contact .  knowing the massive tail was approaching her  kristy scurried over the sharks back and tucked her fins in to avoid being struck by the tail .  equally concerned about the danger of impact and the possibility of upsetting the whale shark  she made sure that she was out of the way .  being in the presence of such a huge and majestic creature leaves a lasting impression that will never be forgotten .   source & embed code: https: /  / rumble . com / v6riow-scuba-diver-has-to-hop-over-whale-shark-to-avoid-approaching-tail . html .   for licensing  please email licensing@rumble . com .

__label__poor Diving Thailand Sail Rock 12 June 2017 Underwater video Considered the premier dive site in the Gulf of Thailand ,  Sail Rock  is a pinnacle which rises to 15m above and 40m below the surface .  Sail Rock lies between Koh Phangan and Koh tao .  Its famous for its natural underwater vertical swim through or chimney which divers can enter at 6 metres and exit at 18 .  It is also the visiting site of many larger pelagic fish  including chevron barracuda ,  big schools of mackerel ,  jacks ,  trevally and tuna .  You may encounter a seasonal whale shark with over 40 spotted at Sail Rock in 2013 alone .   Giant moray eels and lion fish have also taken up residency .  The Trigger fish are also very playful during their nesting period ! nnhttps: /  / www . pond5 . com / artist / Kovbannhttp: /  / hinbhairesort . comnhttp: /  / en . fotolia . com / p / 203930711 / partner / 203930711 [Sail , Rock , diving , underwater , video , fish , whale , u043Au0438u0442u043Eu0432u0430u044F , u0430u043Au0443u043Bu0430 , uACE0uB798 , uC0C1uC5B4 , shark , u0E09u0E25u0E32u0E21u0E27u0E32u0E2C , PADI , course , IDC , center , star , BullShark , dive , barracuda , funny , grouper , angel , bigeye , maclel , queenfish , undersea , coral , jellyfish , u30B8u30F3u30D9u30A4u30B6u30E1 , starfish , wether , report , aquatic , manta , ray , u043Fu043Eu0434u0432u043Eu0434u043Du043Eu0435 , u0432u0438u0434u0435u043E

Black Rock is our third dive when diving at Bat Islands .  It is a protruding pinnacle and drops to over 150ft .  You have to watch your depth and keep an eye on your dive computers .  We normally try to stay between 40 and 70 ft .  Due to the currents and surges we see many schools of fish and a good chance for mantas and also whale sharks . nnwww . sirenasdivingcostarica . comnnMoseying around  .  .  .  mirando a todos los peces y estamos buceando en Bajo Negro ,  Isla Murciu00E9lagos .

Encontramos algunos bonitos tiburones de arrecife de punta blanca nadando debajo de nosotros .  Tienes que ver tu profundidad y controlar tus computadoras de buceo .  Normalmente intentamos permanecer entre 40 y 70 pies .  Los tiburones tenu00EDan al menos 80 pies .  El visibilidad fue realmente bueno y se podu00EDa ver todo el camino hasta el fondo .

__label__poor Whale experts call for rethink of global shipping routes to stop marine giants becoming u2018roadkillu2019 In a new report ,  researchers from Macquarie University are calling for a rethink of global shipping routes ,  to protect whales and sharks from becoming marine u2018roadkillu2019 . More than 10 billion metric tons of goods travel by sea each year ,  making up 80 per cent of the worldu2019s merchandise trade . The continual growth of the shipping trade and rebounding of some whale populations post-whaling is leading to increasing clashes between cargo ships and marine giants . Melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through previously untouched whale habitats . Marine megafauna like Great Whales ,  whale sharks and basking sharks are particularly vulnerable to ships because of their size ,  migration routes and the whalesu2019 need to travel close to the surface for air . Deadly ship strikes are not the only threat to the animals ,  with vessel noise disrupting whalesu2019 delicate communication ,  and chemical pollution and heavily used routes fragmenting habitats . Whale researcher Vanessa Pirotta from Macquarie Universityu2019s Department of Biological Sciences said lessons from the wildlife impacts of roads could be applied to the ocean ,  to prevent marine giants becoming u2018roadkillu2019 . u201CNew shipping routes through whale habitat put vulnerable species at risk ,  and this study provides a new understanding of how to mitigate shipping traffic impacts on these marine giants , u201D Ms Pirotta said . The reportu2019s authors propose limiting the creation of new shipping routes in areas such as the Arctic and broadening shipping exclusion zones to take into account the impact of ships beyond the marine roads themselves ,  such as noise pollution and chemical contamination . Designing cleaner and quieter ships would reduce the risk of oil spills and chemical pollution and reduce underwater noise . In addition ,  implementing speed limits and detours around whale habitats at certain times of year would mitigate some of the negative consequences . Ms Pirotta said: u201CNew technologies can accurately monitor whale populations and behaviour ,  and if combined with data about shipping routes and intensity ,  could provide a clearer picture of their interaction . u201CLooking at the impacts of roads on wildlife populations can then help predict what might happen if the shipping industry continues to expand ,  and this can inform better management plans to protect our marine giants . u201DPirotta ,  V .  , Grech ,  A .  , Jonsen ,  I .  , Laurance ,  W . and Harcourt ,  R .

__label__poor Sharks Processing Factory In China A horrific look behind the scenes of the dietary supplement and bogus traditional Chinese medicine industry in Puqi ,  Zhejiang Province ,  China .  Workers are seen chopping up the sharks and manta rays in unsanitary conditions that resemble a real charnel house .  Many types of sharks are slaughtered in their thousands annually ,  then boiled up to remove the cartilage then ground to a powder for glucosamine sulphate and chondroitin joint repair dietary supplements .  These health products are used by millions of people across the globe daily for bad elbows and knees .  The filthy carnage seen on the floor of this factory would have been exported and sold in Europe ,  America and Asia .  Manta ray gill rakers are used as a newly concocted bogus traditional Chinese medicine .  WildLifeRisk is calling on the Chinese government to enact tougher wildlife protection legislation ,  and is pushing for greater enforcement of existing laws .  WildLifeRisk is also calling on the public worldwide to refrain from consuming supposed health products such as Omega 3 fish oil  ( actually derived from whale shark liver oil ,  or squalene )  and glucosamine sulphate or chondroitin joint repair dietary supplements which both contain shark-related products .

In general ,  hymns in the central text of the Sikhs ,  the Guru Granth Sahib ,  are called Gurbani .  Among Amrit dhari Sikhs ,  a few texts from Dasam Granth which are read as Nitnem ,  like Tav-Prasad Savaiye and Chaupai ,  are also considered Gurbani .

__label__poor Divers explore the magical underwater world of Roatu00E1n ,  Honduras Roatu00E1n is one of Hondurasu2019s Caribbean Bay Islands .  Being part of the huge Mesoamerican Barrier Reef ,  it is known for its beautiful white sand beaches ,  scuba diving sites and marine life ,  including whale sharks .  In the southwest is busy West Bay Beach ,  with a coral reef near the shore which is where Brent and Elsa found themselves on this day in November 2018 .  Boarding a panga boat in west bay they scooted to the very near dive site called ZIGZAG .  Descending below the waves brought Brent and Elsa an amazing dive with some gorgeous creatures common in the area . nnAlthough Roatan is a small island it offers up more than 30 dive sites around its perimeter .  Intriguing names such as Turtle Crossing ,  Spooky Channel and Green Outhouse Reef are just a few of the dive locations you will find around the reef .  Thinking about exploring Honduras Bay Islands and possibly specifically Roatan ?  The first explorer in history to land here was Christopher Columbus in 1502 .  He was not the first one there though ,  the people known as the Paya Indians are known to have inhabited these beautiful islands back as far as 600 AD .  Whether a scuba diving enthusiast or someone that just loves to travel and explore ,  Roatan has a lot to offer for such a small island . nnNot a snorkeler or diver ?  The west bay has some great shops offering up some beautiful handmade treasures or sit on the gorgeous sandy beaches and enjoy a cold drink with your toes in the Caribbean waters .  Are you a daredevil ?  Take in a jet ski tour racing through the local bays .  You can also get harnessed up for a speedy slide on the zip lines at Monkey Trail Canopy at Gumbalimba Park .  Foodie ?  Well there are definitely some great restaurants and beach side bars offering up some local treats of seafood and a local specialty called Baleadas .  These are homemade flour tortillas filled with beans and cheese and are just $1 !  Try them with avocado ,  eggs ,  chicken or meat . nnSource & embed code: https: /  / rumble . com / v6xscs-divers-explore-the-magical-underwater-world-of-roatan-honduras . html . nnFor licensing ,  please email licensing@rumble . com .

__label__poor Giant Shark Bit In Half:  Giant Shark Vs Mega Shark Or Megalodon - Hoax Or Not |  WallaceDaily Giant Shark Bit In Half:  Giant Shark Vs Mega Shark Or Megalodon - Hoax Or Not |  WallaceDailyngiant shark found on beach was attacked by mega shark ,  or megalodon .  megalodon still alive ? nngiant shark vs mega shark or megalodon ?   hoax or notnthis massive shark was found bit in half off of the florida coast ,  what monster could have eaten this ? nnwelcome back my hoax factor friends its cary darling and im sitting here looking at this image of a half eaten shark on the beach and thinking to myselfnholy crap !   im glad summer is over . nwhy ?   because my mom took me to see the movie jaws when i was a kid and that pretty much scarred me for life .   i became so afraid of water ,  that i even worried that i could get eaten by a shark just sitting on the toiler . nhey mom just wanna say thank you for the years of terror . nfuck younso back to this image that is getting shared on social media like mono . nclaims associated with the image were that a giant or enormous dead shark was pulled out of the water in daytona beach florida .  .  . and something ate that bitch like it was a bite sized snickers . ninternet scientists  from all over twitter ,  facebook ,  instagram and the labs of snapchat hypothesized that it could have been eaten by a super predator like a mega shark ,  or the legendary megalodon . nnso what happened to this massive beast ? nnthe largest living shark is a whale shark and can grow up to 32 . 5 feet long ,  but it is a filter feeding shark and its diet consists plankton ,  krill ,  fish eggs and small squid or fish so we can rule this out . nnthe next largest living shark is the basking shark which grows between 22 and 29 feet long .   but the basking shark too is a filter feeding shark that  feeds off of primarily plankton . nnand then theres the great white shark ,  an apex predator that can grow up to 20 feet in length and weigh over 4 , 300 lbs . nrecently there have been sightings of massive great white sharks that might even exceed those lengths . nthis is aerial shots of a great white shark off of a south australian beach that was estimated to being between 6 and 7 meters long 23 feet . nncould it have been a giant  great white shark that bit this one in half ? nancient astronaut theory says yes .  .  . noh wait ,  thats another show .   ancient astronaut theory is that crap these idiots spouts off in an attempt at giving credit to conjecture . nbut yes ,  real scientists say sharks can attack other sharks . nnin 2014 the smithsonian channel aired a documentary titled hunt for the super predator ,  where filmmaker dave riggs investigated the incident of a 9 foot shark that was being tracked ,  had been eaten by something much larger . nwhatever at the shark its internal body temperature was measured by the sharks tag . nu201Cthe internal temperature of the animal that ate the shark is a weird one .  it appears to be too low for a killer whale and too high for another shark ,  unless it was massive . nthe theory is that it was done by a massive deep sea shark . nncould that shark be the legendary megalodon ? nnmegalodon is considered to be one of the largest and most powerful predators in vertebrate history . nit most likely looked like a roided out great white shark but reached lengths of almost 60 feet long . nbut the megalodon died out over 2 . 6 million years ago so most likely not . nbut who knows what lurks beneath the oceans ,  maybe there still is some megalodon monster still lurking out there in the deepest part of the ocean . nnso what happened to this critter here ? nthat answer coming right up ,  but first dont forget to check out my new blog channel where i make an even bigger fool of myself for you guys . nthis little guy ,  and yes i said little guy was a black tip shark and measured about 2 . 5 feet long . nthe carcass was about 30 inches long and according to tara dodson ,  environmental supervisor for st .  johns county ,  u201Cits most likely it was bitten in half by another shark . u201Dnonce again ,  what we have here is forced perspective ,  which turns an itty bitty shark into a giant massive monster shark . nnlets connectn--n--n--nnour other channels:n- always angela:n- hoax factor vlogs:nnSubscribe & More Videos: https: /  / goo . gl / 76bn4onThank for watching ,  Please Like Share And SUBSCRIBE !  !  ! n#biggestsharksevercaught ,  #greatwhite [biggest sharks ever caught , great white , shark , fishing , giant sharks , mega shark , giant shark , jaws , sea , worlds biggest shark , megalodon caught on tape , documentary  ( tv genre )  , megalodon  ( organism classification )  , hunt for the super predator , whale shark , caught on tape , megalodon caught , hungry shark , megalodon , sharks , megalodon shark , shark attack , giant shark vs , hoax factor , fisherman  ( profession WallaceDaily , WallaceDailyChannel

__label__poor Amazing Facts ,  Animal Life ,  19 The hammerhead sharks are named for the unusual and distinctive structure of their heads .  Unlike most sharks ,  hammerheads usually swim in schools during the day ,  becoming solitary hunters at night . nnThe megamouth shark is an extremely rare species of deep water shark ,  swam at a depth of around 120 - 160m during day & at nights at depths of between 12 & 25m . nnThe whale shark is a slow-moving filter feeding shark & is the worlds largest shark at about 20m long ,  but it is a harmless giant . nnTiger sharks are apex predators & they eat almost anything ,  which includes tyres ,  bottles ,  clothes ,  human flesh etc . nnThe Japanese spider crab has the greatest leg span of any arthropod ,  reaching 3 . 8m from claw to claw .  The body may grow to a size of 40cm and the whole crab can weigh up to 19kg . nnThe dresser crab or decorator crab usually found covered in seaweed ,  sponges & other sea creatures that acts as a camouflage . nnEvery year in the Christmas Island ,  roads are forced to be closed because of a massive migration of red crabs . nnScorpions glow in the dark & look neon blue if seen it in the moon light . nnThe Eurasian reed warbler is one of the species that are brood parasitized  ( rely on others to raise their young )  ,  by common cuckoo . nnThe colourful and large bill ,  which is some large species measures more than half the length of the body ,  is the hallmark of toucans . nnSociable weaver birds build large compound community nests ,  a rarity among birds & the nest measures about 20ft wide and 10ft high . nnRuppells griffon vulture - the highest flying bird ever ,  has been found at heights up to 11 , 300m  ( 37 , 000 ft )  . nnThere are about 18 species of penguin ,  most of them living in huge colonies called Rookeries along the coast of Antarctica & nearby islands . nnAlex - an African grey parrot ,  learned to count ,  sort out shapes & say more than 100 words ,  but died in 2007 ,  at the age of 31  ( average life span for African grey parrots is 60 years )  . nnLacking teeth ,  ostriches swallow pebbles to grind their food and an adult ostrich carries about 1 kg of stones in its stomach . nnKookaburra is the terrestrial tree kingfishers native to Australia and New Guinea & its loud call sounds like echoing human laughter . nnMushrooms such as Stinkhorns spores has a smell of rotting meat or even poo ,  which attract flies and other insects to help disperse the spores . nnFungi can grow in soil ,  on old wood ,  around baths or on our feet & toenails . nnA frogs two front legs have four toes each ,  while the back legs have five toes each . nnGoliath Frog lacks a vocal sac and so cannot make any sound . nnOctopuses are the first invertebrates to be seen using tools ,  such as using coconut shells to hide from potential predators . nnThe mimic octopus possesses the unique behaviour of taking shape of various animals such as flatfish ,  jellyfish ,  stingray ,  seahorse or deadly sea snake . nnOctopuses have three hearts .  Two branchial hearts pump blood through each of the two gills ,  while the third is a systemic heart that pumps blood through the body . nnAn octopus can open a screw-top bottle or jar with its tentacles . nnWandering albatrosses spend most of their life in flight ,  landing only to breed and feed .  Distances travelled each year are hard to measure ,  but one banded bird was recorded travelling 6000 km in twelve days . nnThe brown skua also known as the Antarctic skua is a large seabird that breeds in the sub Antarctic and Antarctic zones ,  eats penguin eggs and even trash . nnThe ribbon-tailed astrapia is medium-sized only up to 32 cm long ,  but it has the longest tail than any other bird at 1 m long . nnArctic birds keep warm by standing on one leg & tucking their head under a wing . nnThe most obvious characteristic of the flatfish is its asymmetry ,  with both eyes lying on the same side of the head in the adult fish .  In some families ,  the eyes are usually on the right side of the body and in others ,  they are usually on the left . nnA flying fish spent 45 seconds in a single flight & the flights are typically around 50m .  They can use updrafts at the leading edge of waves to cover distances of up to 400m at speeds of more than 70 km / hr & at the maximum altitude is 6m above the surface of the sea .

He had seen these majestic creaturesu2014the worldu2019s largest fishu2014swim alongside his ship during the week-long journey in the Indian Ocean . nnDecades after ,  when a middle-aged Pandey drove along the Gujarat coastline asking people about the u201Cbig fishu201D ,  which did not have a local name ,  no one knew what he was talking about .  Then ,  in 1996 ,  a builder of fibreglass boats in Bhavnagar described the beautifully patterned fish accurately and said that in some villages ,  people hunted it on occasion .  Locals did not eat the fish ,  but they used oil from the liver to waterproof wooden boats . nnPerhaps the boat-builder was unaware of more recent developments: From 1991 onwards ,  whale sharks had been killed in large numbers in Gujarat ,  fuelled by the demand for their fins and meat in South-east Asia and Europe . nnIn any case ,  after the chat with the builder ,  the quest began in earnest .  In 1998 ,  Pandey sighted his first whale shark in the murky waters of the Veraval harbour .  As large as a trawler ,  it lay cut open .  Two men who had clambered on were hacking at its insides .  As life ebbed out of the hapless fish ,  Pandey remembers making a silent pledge: he would save the gentle giants of the Gujarat coast . nnPandeyu2019s crew went about filming the hunting of the whale shark .  In 2000 ,  the resulting documentary u201CShores of Silenceu201D won the Wildscreen Panda Award ,  the equivalent of the Oscar for natural history films  ( watch it here )  One year later ,  after intense lobbying ,  the Indian government banned the killing of whale sharks . nnThat was not all .  In 2002 ,  at a gathering of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora  ( CITES )  ,  even as the conference was winding down ,  the panel agreed to a re-vote on whale sharks .  After watching Pandeyu2019s documentary ,  an overwhelming majority voted to put the fish on a list of species not in immediate danger of extinction ,  but in need of trade restrictions in order to ensure their survival . nnIn India ,  the whale shark was already on a par with the charismatic tiger ,  as far as legal protection goes .  But three years into the ban ,  a survey along the Gujarat coast showed that even in Veraval ,  the hub of the whale shark fisheries ,  few knew of its status . nnA u201CSave the Whale Sharksu201D movement was launched in Gujarat in 2004 ,  to change attitudes towards the fish that visits its shores from September to May .  The campaign was a joint venture of the Wildlife Trust of India-International Fund for Animal Welfare  ( WTI-IFAW )  ,  Tata Chemicals Ltd and the Gujarat forest department . nnWhale shark ,  the largest known fish species .  Photo: Venkat CharloonMorari Bapu ,  a spiritual leader revered by many in Gujarat ,  became a campaign ambassador .  At the launch ,  he spoke about the tradition of non-violence and the idea of honouring guests .  Warming to the theme ,  he equated the visits of whale shark to a beloved daughter coming home to give birth to her child . nnThis metaphor became the theme for a street play which featured a fisherman ,  a potential hunter of whale sharks ,  whose pregnant daughter comes home to deliver her baby .  The plot linked the fate of the fish and that of the daughter ,  so ultimately the fisherman resolves to save and protect both . nnWith the play becoming a hit in the fishing villages ,  the fish known as u201Cbarrelu201D became vhali ,  meaning u201Cdear oneu201D ,  which was the name of the daughter in the play .  A 4oft inflatable whale shark ,  which served as the backdrop ,  drew in the crowds .  Inland ,  too ,  kids loved the life-sized model of vhali .  They touched it and wanted to know more about the fish . nnPorbandar ,  the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi ,  was [asiatic , lion , lioness , cubs , leopard , python , cat , dog , dear , wildlife , animal , attack , sasan , gir , girnar , flora-fauna , forest , national , park , sanctuary , mating , safari , junagadh , junagarh , gujarat , india , rescue , jambur , siddi , tribes , african , license , stock , footage , licensing , Jungle , floods , rain , biodiversity , narendra , modi , great , rare , amezing , unique , u0936u0947u0930 , u090Fu0936u093Fu092Fu093Eu0908 , u092Cu092Cu094Du092Cu0930 , u0936u0947u0930u0928u0940 , u0938u0902u092Du094Bu0917 , u0936u093Eu0935u0915 , u0924u0947u0902u0926u0941u0906 , u091Cu0902u0917u0932 , u0938u093Eu0938u0928 , u0917u093Fu0930 , u0917u0941u091Cu0930u093Eu0924 , u0928u0930u0947u0928u094Du0926u094Du0930 , u092Eu094Bu0926u0940 , u0905u0926u092Du0941u0924 , u0926u0941u0930u094Du0932u092D , u0905u092Du0942u0924u092Au0942u0930u094Du0935 , u0905u0926u094Du0935u093Fu0924u0940u092F , u092Bu093Eu0930u0947u0938u094Du091F , u0935u0928u0938u094Du092Au0924u093F , u091Cu0940u0935 , u091Cu0942u0928u093Eu0917u095D , u092Du093Eu0930u0924

__label__good sharks protect sharks marine policy suggest that around 100 million sharks are killed every year by humans .  this number might be vast beyond comprehension but the journal also recognises that it is a conservative estimate and it could by closer to 273 million killed each year .  taking the 100 million estimate  it works out at 11 416 sharks killed across the globe every single hour .   ( metro . co . uk )   shark killing has to end because  .  .  . as apex predators  sharks play an important role in the ecosystem by maintaining the species below them in the food chain and serving as an indicator for ocean health .  they help remove the weak and the sick as well as keeping the balance with competitors helping to ensure species diversity .  by taking sharks out of the coral reef ecosystem  the larger predatory fish  such as groupers  increase in abundance and feed on the herbivores .  with less herbivores  macroalgae expands and coral can no longer compete  shifting the ecosystem to one of algae dominance  affecting the survival of the reef system .

__label__poor Baby red crabs return !  Guess whos back ?  !  !  This morning ,  millions of tiny baby Christmas Island red crabs have started to drift up onto the shoreline around this incredible island !  A month ago ,  the adult crabs all spawned billions of eggs into the sea ,  and these little guys have been drifting around in the oceanu2019s currents hoping that they donu2019t get eaten by lurking whale sharks and also hoping that this will be one of the years when the currents miraculously bring them back to the island just as they start to transform from free-swimming little Megalopes into mini crabs !  These guys are the lucky survivors ,  clambering ashore to head up into the jungle to live out their lives as land crabs ,  cleaning the forest floor .  After they mature in about 5 years ,  these guys will join the 50-million adult red crabs in their annual migration down to the sea to spawn ,  in a spectacular event Sir David Attenborough describes as one of the Top 10 natural wonders on Earth .  Maybe visit next Dec / Jan / Feb and stay at the luxurious new eco-retreat Swell Lodge on the coast inside the national park to be right in the heart of this extraordinary event !

__label__poor morning devotion for teenagers-january 12  2019 a fish the size of a bus the lord is my light and my salvation  then why should i fear ?  the lord is my strength and protects me from danger  then why should i tremble ?  psalm 27:1  ntv . nnalong with my family i went to a small boat that i had rented in isla mujeres  in mexico .  we soon moved about 30 kilometers [20 miles] into the caribbean sea to look for the whale shark  which was supposed to be migrating around that time of the year .  seeing the whale shark in their natural habitat seemed exciting and intimidating at the same time  as an adult whale shark has the approximate length of a school bus . nnwhen an animal is migrating  it means it is on the move  so for the next two hours our captain conducted a systematic search to find the sharks .  as they often swim on the surface  it was supposed to be easy to find them .  suddenly  the captain and his pilot started screaming and pointing out: whale sharks near the bow of the boat !  i was traveling with my family so my two kids and i quickly put on the dive gear .  thats right; we were going to jump and swim with them !  when you stop and realize that you are about to jump into the water with animals the size of a bus  it can be a bit intimidating; but after learning that they feed by filtration  we knew they were looking for plankton to eat  not people . nncaptain maneuvered to put us in the path of the approaching shark  and he said to jumped .  when the bubbles were gone  we were facing a mouth more than a meter [4 feet] wide !  the shark changed its trajectory to dodge us  so we came back to swim with this huge creature .  we were only able to keep pace for a few minutes .  then the captain lifted us up  and we repeated this time and again without any fear . nnwe all have fears .  by knowing god better  we discover that he can help us overcome any fear that dominates .  share your fears with god in private  and then ask him to help you overcome them .  you wont be disappointed ! nn= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = narrated by: elvin orozco devotional readings for teenagers 2019 passport to adventure by: rich aguilera = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = www . drministries . org | |n=================== [morning devotion  adventist  devotional  matinales  january  saturday 12  2019  adults  young  ladies  women  teenagers  minors  small

__label__poor The Maldives - Scuba Liveaboard ,  Hulhumale ,  Private Islands ,  Ep .  21 After hiking the Annapurna Circuit and relaxing for a few days in Kathmandu we flew to the exact opposite environment landing in the Maldives .  We boarded a 7 day scuba liveaboard and set off towards the atolls .  The scenery was blue in all directions and light turquoise around the island protected reefs .  There were thousands of islands ,  each one more picturesque then the one we just left .  We had some rain and rough seas ,  but that didnu2019t really effect our dives since we were underwater .  Also ,  we are about a month out of season ,  which is why we were able to afford this deeply discounted ship .  All in all we did so many dives for us that it would be almost too much .  We pushed our limits of decompression diving ,  saw some amazing underwater marine life ,  and went searching unsuccessfully for the Whaleshark . nnSummary of our dive logs:nnLankan Paradiss ,  North Maw Atoll  /  /  22 meters ,  57 minutes  /  /  5 manta ,  turtle ,  octopus ,  eelnKandooma Thila ,  South Male  /  /  32 . 2 meters ,  42 minutes  /  /  2 sharksnAlimathy Jetty ,  Vaauu Atoll  /  /  13 . 6 meters ,  43 minutes  /  /  night dive with Nurse sharks everywherenMyrna Kandu ,  Vaauu Atoll  /  /  32 meters ,  52 minutes  /  /  drift dive ,  2 eels ,  pooping parrotfishnKudu Rah Thilla ,  South Ari Atoll  /  /  27 . 4 meters ,  49 minutes  /  /  nudi branch ,  2 octopus ,  6 sharksnBroken Rock ,  South Ari Atoll  /  /  27 . 4 meters ,  55 minutes  /  /  white tip and black tip reef sharks ,  Phantom Bannerfish schoolnDiggunah boyro ,  South Ari Atoll  /  /  25 . 1 meters ,  54 minutes  /  /  No whaleshark ,  scorpionfish ,  nudibranch ,  eelsnRadiggah Thila ,  South Atoll  /  /  29 meters ,  47 minutes  /  /  large school of barracudanMoo Fushi Corner ,  North Ari Atoll  /  /  33 . 6 meters ,  55 minutes  /  /  20-30 black tip reef sharks ,  2 safety stopsnMoo Fushi Corner ,  North Ari Atoll second dive  /  /  37 . 8 meters ,  44 minutes  /  /  10 reef sharks ,  25 eagle rays ,  2 safety stopsnFesdhoo Wreck ,  North Ari Atoll  /  /  31 . 2 meters ,  44 minutes  /  /  wreck dive ,  eels ,  manta ,  octopus ,  harlequin sweetlipsnFish Head ,  North Ari Atoll  /  /  33 meters ,  61 minutes  /  /  reef sharks ,  octopusnMaaya Thila  /  /  31 meters ,  51 minutes  /  /  10 sharks ,  2 eagle rays ,  2 turtles ,  nudibranch ,  octopusnBatala Kanthila  /  /  22 . 1 meters ,  60 minutes  /  /  sharks ,  triggerfish ,  octopus ,  nudibranchnLion Head ,  Maldives  /  /  35 . 3 meters ,  51 minutes  /  /  drift dive ,  wall dive ,  last divennNext  /  /  We charter a boat in Lefkada ,  Greece and sail around the Ionian seannMusic:nHow About Nah  /  /  roljuinMuffled Tines  /  /  roljuinnhttp: /  / www . wherewejoy . com [maldives , hulhumale , private islands , liveaboard , scuba , scuba dive , manta , shark , whaleshark , atolls , decompression

__label__good the biggest fish in the sea  the whaleshark  ( rhincodon typus )   koh tao  thailand .  the whale shark  ( rhincodon typus )  is a slow-moving  filter-feeding carpet shark and the largest known extant fish species .  the largest confirmed individual had a length of 12 . 65 m  ( 41 . 5 ft )  and a weight of about 21 . 5 t  ( 47 000 lb )  .  the whale shark holds many records for size in the animal kingdom  most notably being by far the largest living nonmammalian vertebrate .  it is the sole member of the genus rhincodon and the only extant member of the family rhincodontidae which belongs to the subclass elasmobranchii in the class chondrichthyes .  before 1984 it was classified as rhiniodon into rhinodontidae .   the whale shark is found in open waters of the tropical oceans and is rarely found in water below 21 u00B0c  ( 70 u00B0f )  . [2] modeling suggests a lifespan of about 70 years  but measurements have proven difficult . [9] whale sharks have very large mouths and are filter feeders  which is a feeding mode that occurs in only two other sharks  the megamouth shark and the basking shark .  they feed almost exclusively on plankton and small fishes  and pose no threat to humans .   cjeck out my facebook & instaggram for more photos & videos .  https: /  / www . facebook . com / videoandphotowtc /  https: /  / www . instagram . com / wtc . productions /  [whalehark rhincodon typus koh tao scuba diving koh tao diving koh tao diving schools diving school scuba diving certification scuba diving course diving lessons scuba shop diving certification diving in thailand padi courses dive shop koh tao ko tao koh tao thailand scuba diving scuba what is scuba diving best diving in thailand diving big blue diving koh thai padi koh phangan big blue bigblue thailand koh tao

However ,  we did manage to capture some incredible footage from the boat . nnWe experienced a mother and calf trapped in an epic battle with two giant males ,  at times within just a few meters from the boat .  This lasted maybe 30 minutes or longer but was hard to tell with all of the excitement . nnSwimming with the whales was an unforgettable experience but this absolutely made the trip worthwhile for me .

( of course i panicked and hit the record button again so that switched off the video and you cant see how close he came to me .  . duh  sorry about that )  .   the two sharks hung around really relaxed in our company; it was majestic .   ---  whale sharks have unique spots on their backs and bellies similar to human fingerprints making each individual identifiable .  they are not a mammal as whales are  but the largest fish in the ocean  laying eggs rather than birthing live young as whales do .  the term shark comes from the shape of the fins and their bodies but technically they are closer to filter feeding whales at 40 feet long rather than carnivorous sharks .   --  music by christopher comstock https: /  / www . reverbnation . com / chrisvcomstock [whale sharks the gypsie princess scuba divers snorkeling stargate swimming aquatic marine life gulf of mexico chris comstock

__label__good giant whale shark in thousand islands-jakarta itu2019s sometimes easy to forget that jakarta is actually a coastal city  one that extends out into the sea thanks to the thousand islands and the bay of jakarta .  many jakartans still make their livings as fishermen and many oppose the jakarta bay reclamation project as they fear it will destroy their livelihoods .   while the number of fish in jakarta bay may already be decreasing due to the project  ( not to mention pollution )   it certainly hasnu2019t scared off all of them  as evidenced by this video of an astonished group of divers encountering a giant whale shark  a member of the largest living species of fish  while they were diving around thousand islands .   dharmadi  a researcher at the ministry of maritime affairs and fisheries specializing in sharks and rays  said the  whale sharku2019s presence in jakarta bay was quite rare but not unprecedented .   u201Ci suspect  the presence of whale sharks was because of the food u201D dharmadi told detik  adding that whale sharks usually stay in deep waters but often go into shallower areas in search of food  mainly plankton and small fish  which can be dangerous if they get stuck somewhere during low tide .

In place of pranks we love toys learning friendship together ,  and theres sure to be plenty of fun surprises as well .  So join our finger family for nursery rhymes learning and fun games with color changing Finding Dory toys ! nninding Dory is a 2016 American 3D computer-animated comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures . nnDory ,  a regal blue tang ,  gets separated from her parents as a child .  As she grows up ,  Dory attempts to search for them ,  but gradually forgets them due to her short-term memory loss disability .  In the flashback of the previous film ,  Finding Nemo ,  after accidentally running into Marlin ,  a clownfish who is looking for his missing son ,  Nemo ,  she joins him on his journey . nnOne year later ,  Dory has joined Marlin and Nemo on their reef .  One day ,  Dory has a flashback and remembers that she has parents .  She decides to look for them ,  but finds her memory problem an obstacle .  She remembers that they lived at the Jewel of Morro Bay across the ocean in California . nnMarlin and Nemo accompany Dory .  With the help of Crush ,  a sea turtle friend ,  they ride a water current to California .  Upon arrival ,  Dory accidentally awakens a squid ,  who immediately pursues them ,  almost devouring Nemo .  Marlin berates Dory for endangering them .  Her feelings hurt ,  Dory travels to the surface to seek help and is captured by staff members from the nearby Marine Life Institute after getting entangled in six pack rings . nnDory is placed in the quarantine section and tagged .  There she meets a grouchy but well-meaning octopus named Hank .  Dorys tag shows that she will be sent to an aquarium in Cleveland .  Due to a traumatic ocean life ,  Hank wants to live in the aquarium instead of being released back into the ocean ,  so he agrees to help Dory find her parents in exchange for her tag .  In one exhibit ,  Dory encounters her childhood friend Destiny ,  a nearsighted whale shark who used to communicate with Dory through pipes ,  and Bailey ,  a beluga whale who mistakenly believes he has lost his ability to echolocate .  Dory subsequently has flashbacks of life with her parents and struggles to recall details .  She finally remembers how she was separated from her parents: she overheard her mother crying one night ,  left to retrieve a shell to cheer her up ,  and was pulled away by an undertow current . nnMarlin and Nemo attempt to rescue Dory .  With the help of two sea lions named Fluke and Rudder and a disfigured common loon named Becky ,  they manage to get into the institute and find her in the pipe system .  Other blue tangs tell them that Dorys parents escaped from the institute a long time ago to search for her and never came back ,  leaving Dory believing that they have died .  Hank retrieves Dory from the tank ,  accidentally leaving Marlin and Nemo behind .  He is then apprehended by one of the employees and unintentionally drops Dory into the drain ,  flushing her out to the ocean .  While wandering aimlessly ,  she comes across a trail of shells; remembering that when she was young ,  her parents had set out a similar trail to help her find her way back home ,  she follows it .  At the end of the trail ,  Dory finds an empty home with multiple shell trails leading to it .  As she turns to leave ,  she sees her parents Jenny and Charlie in the distance .  They tell her they spent years laying down the trails for her to follow in the hopes that she would eventually find them . nnMarlin ,  Nemo ,  and Hank end up in the truck taking various aquatic creatures to Cleveland .  Destiny and Bailey escape from their exhibit to help Dory rescue them .  Once on board the truck ,  Dory persuades Hank to return to the sea with her ,  and together ,  they hijack the truck and drive it over busy highways ,  creating havoc ,  before crashing it into the ocean ,  freeing all the fish .  Dory ,  along with her parents and new friends ,  return to the reef with Marlin and Nemo . nnHeres how to say Disney Finding Dory in other languages: u062Fu064Au0632u0646u064A u0627u0644u0639u062Bu0648u0631 u0639u0644u0649 u062Fu0648u0631u064A ,  u8FEAu58EBu5C3Cu627Eu5230dory ,  Disney paghahanap dory ,  Disney recherche dory ,  Disney findet dory ,  u30C7u30A3u30BAu30CBu30FCu3092u898Bu3064u3051u308Bu30C9u30EAu30FC ,  uB514uC988uB2C8 uCC3EuAE30 uB3C4uB9AC ,  Disney encontrando dory ,  u0414u0438u0441u043Du0435u0439 u0441u0447u0438u0442u0430u0435u0442 ,  u0447u0442u043E ,  [Toon Tube , Yippee toys , Baby Big Mouth , TheEngineeringFamily , learning video , juego , brinquedos , surpresas , full episodes , full movie , cartoon , toy review , finger family , nursery rhymes , finding dory toys , finding dory color change , learn your colors , learn colors , finding dory surprise eggs , dory colors , dory color change , finding nemo color change , dory coloring

__label__poor Brave Rhino Tries to Withstand the Elephant - Wild Animals Fighting Rhino meets elephants and tries to prove that he is the owner of the territory .  What will be the outcome ? nnA rhinoceros ,  often abbreviated to rhino ,  is one of any five extant species of odd-toed ungulates in the family Rhinocerotidae ,  as well as any of the numerous extinct species .  Two of these extant species are native to Africa and three to Southern Asia .  Members of the rhinoceros family are characterized by their large size  ( they are some of the largest remaining megafauna ,  with all of the species able to reach one tonne or more in weight ) ; as well as by an herbivorous diet; a thick protective skin ,  1 . 5u20135 cm thick ,  formed from layers of collagen positioned in a lattice structure; relatively small brains for mammals this size  ( 400u2013600 g ) ; and a large horn .  They generally eat leafy material ,  although their ability to ferment food in their hindgut allows them to subsist on more fibrous plant matter ,  if necessary .  Unlike other perissodactyls ,  the two African species of rhinoceros lack teeth at the front of their mouths ,  relying instead on their lips to pluck food .  Rhinoceros are killed by humans for their horns ,  which are bought and sold on the black market ,  and which are used by some cultures for ornamental or traditional medicinal purposes .  East Asia ,  specifically Vietnam ,  is the largest market for rhino horns .  By weight ,  rhino horns cost as much as gold on the black market .  People grind up the horns and then consume them believing the dust has therapeutic properties .  The horns are made of keratin ,  the same type of protein that makes up hair and fingernails .  Both African species and the Sumatran rhinoceros have two horns ,  while the Indian and Javan rhinoceros have a single horn . nnElephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea .  Two species are traditionally recognised ,  the African elephant and the Asian elephant ,  although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species .  Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa ,  South Asia ,  and Southeast Asia .  Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other ,  now extinct ,  members of the order include deinotheres ,  gomphotheres ,  mammoths ,  and mastodons .  Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of 4 m  ( 13 ft )  and weigh 7 , 000 kg  ( 15 , 000 lb )  .  All elephants have several distinctive features ,  the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis ,  used for many purposes ,  particularly breathing ,  lifting water ,  and grasping objects .  Their incisors grow into tusks ,  which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging .  Elephants large ear flaps help to control their body temperature .  Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight .  African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs .  Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs ,  forests ,  deserts ,  and marshes .  They prefer to stay near water .  They are considered to be keystone species due to their impact on their environments .  Other animals tend to keep their distance from elephants while predators ,  such as lions ,  tigers ,  hyenas ,  and wild dogs ,  usually target only young elephants  ( or calves )  .  Females  ( cows )  tend to live in family groups ,  which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring .  The groups are led by an individual known as the matriarch ,  often the oldest cow .  Elephants have a fissionu2013fusion society in which multiple family groups come together to socialise .  Males  ( bulls )  leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males .  Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth ,  which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success .  Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years .  Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild . nnAll information according to www . wikipedia . orgnnBison vs Grizzly Bear vs Moose vs Elk vs Deer vs Buffalo vs Wolf vs Bull vs Lion vs Tiger vs Elephant vs Giraffe vs Rhino vs Gorilla vs Whale vs Shark vs Panther vs Python vs Anaconda vs Jaguar vs Boar vs Walrus vs Polar Bear vs Hyena vs Warthog vs Hippo vs Wolves vs Wolfpack vs Cobra vs Mongoose vs Alligator vs Yak vs Piranha .

Locals and divers ran to see as the fisheman proudly dragged their catch to shore .

__label__poor World biggest shark / whale world bigges shark The whale shark  ( Rhincodon typus )  is a slow-moving filter-feeding carpet shark and the largest known extant fish species .  The largest confirmed individual had a length of 12 . 65 m  ( 41 . 5 ft )  and a weight of about 21 . 5 t  ( 47 , 000 lb )  . [3] Unconfirmed claims of considerably larger individuals ,  over 14 m  ( 46 ft )  long and weighing at least 30 t  ( 66 , 000 lb )  ,  are not uncommon . [citation needed] The whale shark holds many records for sheer size in the animal kingdom ,  most notably being by far the largest living nonmammalian vertebrate .  It is the sole member of the genus Rhincodon and the only extant member of the family Rhincodontidae  ( called Rhiniodon and Rhinodontidae before 1984 )  ,  which belongs to the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes .  The species originated about 60 million years ago .

Pictured is an ultrasoundu00A0   Its thanks to its docile nature that scientists have been able to complete ultrasounds and take blood samples from these sharks in the Galapagos   The incredible results allowed them to see and identify reproductive organs ,  such as the ovaries ,  and even developing follicles   Researchers led by conservationists from the Galapagos Whale Shark Project looked at whale sharks near Darwin Island ,  in the far north of the Galapagos Archipelago   This remote volcanic island is one of the few places where huge adult female whale sharks ,  which are up to 14 m  ( 45 ft )  in length ,  are commonly seen each year  While they are comparable in size to whales ,  whale sharks are sharks   They typically grow to be bigger than a double-decker bus: between 6 to 16 meters  ( 20 to 52 feet )  and more than 20 tons   The gentle giants arent particularly fast when compared to other sharks ,  but a simple wave of their tail propels them through the water faster than any human could ever swim   Almost nothing is known about the reproduction of these giant sharks ,  said Jonathan R .  Green ,  the expedition leader and founder of the Galapagos Whale Shark Project   After I first saw these huge female whale sharks in the far north Galapagos ,  I realised that this was a great opportunity to learn more ,  said Dr Green   Weve been able to put together an experienced team to research sharks in this remote area ,  one of the worlds most isolated dive sites ,  Dr Green said   All tags are transmitting well ,  so we should get great information on where these sharks swim over the months to come ,  said Professor Hearn   Kiyomi Murakumo from Okinawa Churashima Foundation ,  successfully collected blood samples from six adult sharks   Sex steroid hormone levels in the blood are an excellent way to monitor reproduction in individual sharks ,  Dr Murakumo said   This study measured levels of estradiol ,  progesterone and testosterone of wild ,  adult female whale sharks for the first time in the world   Whale sharksu00A0feed by scooping huge amounts of tiny plankton and small fish from the water - particularly near the surface and in warm water   They typically grow to be bigger than a double-decker bus: between 6 to 16 meters  ( 20 to 52 feet )  and more than 20 tons   As filter feeders ,  the enormous whale sharks are dangerous only to the plankton ,  fish eggs and tiny fish they chomp onnAutoNews- Source:https: /  / www . dailymail . co . uk / sciencetech / article-6319721 / Scientists-taken-ultrasounds-wild-whale-sharks-Galapagos . html ? ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490 [Scientists , taken , ultrasounds , wild , whale , sharks , Galapagos , AutoNews , breaking news , hot news , sciencetech

__label__poor 5 extinct animals captured in camera and seen in real life !  5 extinct animals captured on camera in real life description: extinction has been a controversial subject since it was suggested by scientists in the 19th century .  in the time elapsed since then  the evidence has come to show that extinction might not be so permanent after all .  with this said these are 5 extinct animals captured on camera and seen in real life .   .  .  .  .  ready ?  ?   .  .  .  start .  .  .  !  ! nn1 .  dinosaur in africa while the rest of the animals have lived recently  this animal lived millions of years ago .  a tribe in the republic of congo was reportedly captured by a velociraptor in the jungle  which they proudly put on display .  while the dinosaurs allegedly became extinct 65 million years ago  some people believe that the small populations continued to survive in the deepest and darkest desert  far from human contact .  sometimes it is believed that these possible survivors are the origin of dragons  snakes and other great monsters of human mythology .  it may be possible that something undiscovered and unexplained continue to prosper in the 500 million hectares of rainforest in the congo that inspired the story of joseph conrad heart of darkness . nn2 .  the whale omura the omura whale is a species of whale recently discovered originally in the years 2000 by a japanese researcher .  it was discovered through dna analysis found in the whale bones at the bottom of the ocean in the years 90 .  it was believed that the whale  which had hitherto been undiscovered  was extinguished .  it was later discovered that the bones belonged to a dwarf fin or pygmy whale that was rarely seen across asia . nn3 .  mammoth wooly mammoth wooly is believed to have been hunted to extinction by man during the ice age .  while their relatives survived to become a modern asian elephant  mammoths are theorized to have been dead 10 000 years ago .  some have theorized that the woolly mammoths continued to live and existed in cold regions where they were safe from humans and warmer temperatures .  they believe that the preserved and mummified corpses of mammoths found in these areas could be evidence of this  and sightings of mammoths have been reported in the wild .  this video captures one of those sightings like a wooly mammoth allegedly tries to cross a frozen river in a forest in siberia . nn4 .  tasmanian tiger the tasmanian tiger was a carnivorous marsupial that emigrateded australia before it died .  it is also known as the wolf tasmano  despite having no relationship with wolves or tigers  due to its appearance of dog and tiger-striped .  the tasmanian tigers were already rare before the british settlers arrived  and they believed they had died out on the island of australia  although the species continued to live on the island of tasmania from which it took its name .  due to a combination of excessive hunting and habitat invasion  this creature would have been extinguished in the 1990s  when the last wild tasmanian tiger was killed in 1930 .  on the other hand .  there have always been rumors about this subject .  .  and this video captures a tasmanian tiger in australia .  go .  .  . nn5 .  megalodon the myths about big fish as sea monsters are universal to human conditions .  the best known may be the legend of the leviathan  an ancient and giant fish or whale who ate the biblical figure job .  although traditionally it was believed that the leviathan had been a whale  the discovery of the ancient and supposedly extinct megalodon shark led people to believe that perhaps the inspiration for leviathan had originally been a giant shark .  while it is believed that the megalodonios are extinct  only 5% of the ocean has been explored and day-to-day biologists discover new species of creatures and even rediscover species that were previously considered extinct .  it is not impossible that an evolutionary return to the megalodon can continue to exist .  this giant shark was captured by the japanese marine biologists in 2016 background music: kevin macleod-kevin macleod music of the end: for copyright subjects  do not hesitate to send me an email here: officialamerikano@hotmail . com _____ ______ _____ .  .  .  __________ .  .  .  .  __________ thank you very much for watching this video .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  give like if you liked this video [animals  creatures  strangers  real life  captured in camera  captured in video  captured in camara  extinct animals  that could revive  in camera  viral  real  strange animals  captured  monsters  megalodon  strangers animals   extinction   extinct animals   live animals   extinct creatures   captured in camera   captured in video   captured   extinct animals that could remain alive   captured   extinct   animals found alive   captured

__label__good whale sharks of oslob whale shark dive at oslob .   obviously a bit of a controversial place to dive  its basically a fish tank - i tried my best to crop out the approx .  100 snorkellers from the video !  didnt really know the background before we went  ( ie local fishermen feed the sharks -  allegedly this stops them being caught in nets  which the fishermen historically put across the straight  which is a migration route .   however  the sharks are clearly now resident and dont migrate at all  does the huge amount of revenue created go back into conservation ?  allegedly  yes .   would i go back - no .   but there is a part of me that thinks this is no difference to feeding migratory birds in the park .  .  .  )  [whale shark oslob scuba diving kathryn foyle philippenes

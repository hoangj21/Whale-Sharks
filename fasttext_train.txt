Our trip was organized by the guesthouse Koimala Hotel .  The boat in which we went in search of a whale shark also belongs to this guesthouse .  The boat is run by the employees of this hotel .  On this day we were lucky with the weather .  The sun was shining brightly ,  a gentle wind was blowing and the Indian Ocean was calm .  Our trip lasted about 3 hours .  We three times jumped into the water to look at the Whale Shark ,  but Ira and I only once  ( and not for very long )  saw the blurred shadow of the Whale Shark at depth .  In the second part of the video hit the moment when in the bottom of the place gathered boats and boats .  If you look around ,  you can count them up to a dozen . nChannel #TaksaTravels In Search of a Whale Shark . n--------nREST MALDIVA 2018 INDEPENDENTLY https: /  / www . youtube . com / playlist ? list=PLalvdWvkzTWArcV818FSxv_gaZRuRU-wCnnPOWER SUPPLY  ( FOOD )  MALDIVA 2018 INDEPENDENTLY https: /  / www . youtube . com / playlist ? list=PLalvdWvkzTWATh5jQvngYqzER2iOrgtxpnnMALDIVES 2018 REST FOR TWO https: /  / www . youtube . com / playlist ? list=PLalvdWvkzTWBrFMTUYzjSOBBVKZLni0qknnMAAFUSHI ISLAND 2018 MALDIVES INDEPENDENTLY https: /  / www . youtube . com / playlist ? list=PLalvdWvkzTWDBkm_UUrUlXicEpouBMfDdnnISLAND HULHUMALE 2018 MALDIVES INDEPENDENTLY https: /  / www . youtube . com / playlist ? list=PLalvdWvkzTWB2I763Z_xbNN4IjtXZZitfnnISLAND MAMIGILEY 2018 MALDIVES INDEPENDENTLY https: /  / www . youtube . com / playlist ? list=PLalvdWvkzTWCC60VJNBIDUSlVHHBl1FaznnISLAND GURAYDO 2018 MALDIVES INDEPENDENTLY https: /  / www . youtube . com / playlist ? list=PLalvdWvkzTWCX_1BMbpYETuap2oaeCEnknnISLAND OF THE DISTRIBUTION 2018 MALDIVES INDEPENDENTLY https: /  / www . youtube . com / playlist ? list=PLalvdWvkzTWDCEFDR32JVEE-3znk-uSx7nnMALE CITY 2018 MALDIVES INDEPENDENTLY https: /  / www . youtube . com / playlist ? list=PLalvdWvkzTWCXdLcCBElE9qeaLJ9Fx-QwnnMALDIVES 2018 HEART ON EARTH https: /  / www . youtube . com / playlist ? list=PLalvdWvkzTWAoch8vugsEpvQARpEVmNzwnnOur channel: TaksaTravels - Dmitry and Irina https: /  / www . youtube . com / channel / UCB8aK4tCxZnj9SMyG1Lj4Tg [u043Cu0430u043Bu044Cu0434u0438u0432u044B , Maldives , u0432u0438u0434u0435u043E 360 u0433u0440u0430u0434u0443u0441u043Eu0432 , video 360 degrees

__label__good divers swim through hammerheads to meet huge whale shark whale sharks are the largest known fish in the ocean .  with the exception of some whale species  they are the largest animals on earth .  although we know very little about them  we do know that they can reach a length of 55 feet or more and can live to over 70 years of age .  the weight of a full grown whale shark is estimated to be approximately 50 000 pounds .  roughly the size of a school bus  they dwarf even the largest great white sharks .  they are gentle and slow moving giants that feed on plankton  krill  small fish  fish eggs and crab larvae .  although they have enormous mouths  they are filter feeders and incapable of posing a threat to humans or any other large animals .  they follow ocean currents to feed  populating all tropical seas .  with one of the most distinctive skin patterns in the animal kingdom  they are easily recognizable .  their spots are as unique as the fingerprints of humans .  no two whale sharks are exactly alike .  scuba divers consider whale shark sightings to be one of the most sought after experiences .  for most  it is the ultimate thrill  and swimming alongside one for more than a moment is likely to be one of lifeu2019s most memorable events .  these divers have traveled to darwin island  the most famous of the galapagos islands  hopeful to see a whale shark .  the galapagos are one of the most diverse and remarkable areas on our planet .  the environment is hostile and beautiful at the same time  and because three great currents converge around them  the habitat produces a food supply that attracts hammerhead sharks  galapagos sharks  sea turtles  dolphins  and more pregnant female whale sharks than most other areas of the world .  researchers donu2019t know where they go to have their young but they do know that almost 100 per cent of whale sharks sighted here are mothers carrying babies .  scuba divers make a rapid descent to the rocky bottom  eager to find shelter from the powerful currents that could sweep them away .  they perch themselves on rocky ledges and peer out into the vast blue  waiting for that moment when one of these beautiful beasts will appear in front of them .  the ledge around darwinu2019s arch is aptly named u201Cthe theatreu201D and the show is a live performance that rivals any imax experience .  the divers watch as schools of fish and large hammerhead sharks cruise past  along with occasional turtles and a few other shark species .  the appearance of a whale shark is uncertain and often they are only seen from a distance .  the dive guide will keep one eye on the group and the other on the depths beyond .  if he sees a whale shark  he will signal the group by rattling a small shaker and he will point in the direction that they need to go .  they quickly add air to their buoyancy vests and head into the blue to meet the shark and get a closer look .  this large female whale shark is approximately 50 feet long and is carrying young .  with a slow approach  divers were able to swim alongside her at a depth of about 60 feet .  she calmly swept her tail back and forth  effortlessly maintaining a pace that a diver must work hard to match .  if she becomes concerned  a few powerful sweeps of her massive tail will propel her out of reach in seconds .  she is also capable of descending quickly to retreat from a threat .  whale sharks are often accepting  even curious  when they encounter scuba divers .  a close encounter such as this one is something that very few divers will ever experience and it was a dive that these lucky people will never forget .  the guides and crew of the galapagos sky and float u2018nu2019 flag dive shop provided this group with exceptional memories that will be cherished forever .

__label__poor top 5 dinosaur fights and prehistory  which really happened .  top 5 dinosaur fights and prehistory  which really happened . nsummary: the dinosaurs are considered as titanic monsters who once trod the earth .  but just as in nature  the atmosphere of prehistory  it was a war zone .  where fighting and struggling to survive  was the daily bread .  from clashes between carnivorous and herbivorous dinosaurs  to fights in the sea  by territory .  on this occasion  we will review those dinosaur fights and other great rivalries of prehistory that really happened . nnnnumber 5: spinosaurus vs carcharodontosaurus . nin the 2008  a spinosaurus vertebra was found fractured .  no one knew that animal would be able to inflict such damage on him .  later on  the bbc paleontologists said that this fracture was caused by a carchadontosaurus .  these two dinosaurs usually would not have met  but when the drought affected the environment in which they lived  these carnivores faced more than once  fighting for food . nnnumber 4: titanoboa vs carbonemis . nncolombia  60 million years ago .  this was the scene of a fight of superpredators .  on the one hand  we have the biggest snake known .  .  .  the titanoboa .  this snake  on many occasions was disputed its territory with a tortoise that was just as giant .  .  .  the carbonemys turtle .  paleontologists from the university of north carolina claim that this tortoise had a bite so potent that allowed him to defend himself from predators  and even confront them if necessary .  although there is no evidence that the titanoboa and this tortoise have clashed .  what we do know is that both fossils were found in the same area . nnnumber 3: t-rex vs triceratops . nnthe tyrannosaurus rex is known for being one of the most ruthless predators in the cretaceous .  it is known that he fed on any living being that crossed his path . nhowever  there is a prey  which was not so easy to hunt .  and it is nothing more and nothing less than the triceratops . ntyrannosauruss bite marks on the fossils of triceratops indicate that these two dinosaurs were always struggling for their survival .  many times this struggle has been portrayed in popular culture  both in films and in exhibitions .  having the tyrannosaurus some victories and some defeats . nwithout a doubt  these two dinosaurs converted the cretaceous period into a battlefield for survival . nnnumber 2: bear of the caverns vs .  american lion . nnthe confrontation between the lion of the caverns and the bear of the caverns .  the lion of the caverns  named thus  because several of his bones were found in the caverns .  although it is doubtful that these lions have lived there .  hence  there is a hypothesis that these lions  could have ventured into these caverns  in search of bears for their augmentation .  but because the cave bear  was a giant that reached a height of 1 . 3 meters  many scientists think that the lion attacked them when they were still hibernating . nnnumber 1: gigantosaurus vs argentinosaurus . nnthere is evidence  that these true titans of prehistory have clashed .  on the one hand  the argentinosaurus  a dinosaur with an approximate size of 33 meters in length  and the other  the gigantosaurus  a carnivorous 13 meters long .  it has been speculated that the gigantosaurus  on many occasions hunted these great animals .  but to do so  the gigantosaurus resorted to the group attacks  causing real struggles for survival . nnnnnground zero: megalodon vs livyathan melvillei . nnthe competition for food in the miocene sea .  the miocene  was the time when there were two giant predators .  on one hand the megalodon and the other the lyviathan melivillei  a prehistoric killer whale .  these two predators always vied for food in the miocene sea . nit has been said that his constant struggle for food caused one of them to move from his place of home  and then possibly become extinct . ntoday  killer whales are known to kill large sharks .  would it be that this was also the prehistory ? nthinking about dinosaur fights and prehistoric struggles is a fascinating topic .  we cant know if it really happened .  but what we do know is that prehistory was not a paradise . nnpowered by: http: /  / swordlord3d . deviantart . com material used in this video: music and effects here: http: /  / bit . ly / 2meqfmw animations and videos here: http: /  / bit . ly / 2oakqsz you never know what you can find here  so follow me: facebook: bit . ly / 2aj1v6p [dinosaur fights  rex dinosaur fights  prehistoric animal fights  spinosaurus  t-rex  carnivores dinosaurs  spinosaurus vs carcharodontosaurus  t-rex vs triceratops  giganotosaurus  megalodon  livyathan   livyathan melvillei vs megalodon   bear of the caverns   lion of the caverns   cave bear vs .  american lion   dinosaurs   prehistory   documentaries   top 5   minidocumentales   topman   documentaries in spanish   dinosaur videos

__label__poor the 10 largest sharks in the world  ( depending on species )  the sharks are famous thanks to one of their brothers  known as the great white shark that although it is large and dangerous  is not the largest that exists .  meet the top 10 largest sharks in the world . n------------------------------------------------------description: here the summary of these sharks causing astonishment because of their large size and obviously could not miss on the list our dearest shark: the megalodon that although possibly extinct it gives even to talk . nn-whale shark is the largest species of shark .  it measures 12 meters in length  although several unproven testimonies claim to have seen specimens of 18 meters .  it lives in the warm oceans less than 700 meters deep .  the most numerous group lives in the philippine islands .  its belly is white and its back is grey with dots and white stripes that form a unique design in each individual  like a gigantic fingerprint . nn-white shark the most feared of all sharks can be measured up to 7 . 5 meters in length and while there are some testimonies that claim to have seen larger specimens  have not been confirmed .  his bite is 300 times higher than that of a human jaw . nn-peregrine shark with 10 meters in length is positioned as the second largest fish in the world .  it weighs 4 tonnes  the equivalent of six holstein and half cows .  they live in cold waters between 8 and 14 degrees celsius and plankton is their main food . nn-grey cau00F1abota shark measures 4 . 8 meters in length and weighs a ton  although specimens of more than seven meters have been seen .  it dwells in the warm and temperate depths between 180 and 1100 meters .  it is also called the six-gill shark  which indicates that it is a fairly primitive species because modern sharks only have five gills . nn-boreal shark is also called greenland shark .  it measures between 5 and 6 meters in length .  it lives in the arctic ocean  on the coasts of greenland and iceland  although it has also been seen in argentina and antarctica .  it can reach depths of up to 2000 meters . nn-bocagrande shark is also known as wide mouth shark .  it reaches 5 . 5 meters in length and its mouth measures 1 . 3 meters wide .  it is a very rare species recently discovered in 1976 in hawaii . nn-tiger shark gets its name from the series of transverse dark streaks on the back that tend to fade with age .  the largest specimen found measured 5 . 5 meters in length .   it lives in tropical waters  especially in the central pacific . nn-giant hammerhead shark this species is characterized by its t-shaped head .  the eyes and nostrils are located at the ends of the head .  this way you can see what is behind your back with just rubbing .  its back is gray or brown and its belly is white . nn-mako shark is also known as mako .  it can measure up to 4 . 5 meters in length .  it lives in all the oceans  except in the arctic and antarctic  as it is a fish of warm waters .  it is usually found far from the coasts between the surface and the 150 meters of depth . nn-pacific sleeper shark reaches 4 . 4 meters in length .  it lives in the pacific ocean from the surface to 2000 meters deep .  the warmer the waters  the lower it inhabits .  in some areas it remains in the dark depths during the day and emerges at night . n-----------------------------------------------------------------our social networks u25B6 follow us on facebook: https: /  / goo . gl / klgdoo u25B6 follow us on twitter: https: /  / goo . gl / lgjvj6--------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------topmax is a channel of education and entertainment  dedicated to the creation of tops and interesting and fun lists .  dont miss a single video .  .  .  subscribe !  !  !

For Day 1 ,  we were stuck in the airport due to delayed flight then once we arrived at Cebu ,  we checked in at our hotel then went to the mall to roam around .  After that ,  we ate Cebu lechon WHICH IS THE BEST FOR ME HOMAYGAHD .  It was a simple day for Day 1 because the next day was when we head for Oslob to see the whale sharks .

Black Rock is our third dive when diving at Bat Islands .  It is a protruding pinnacle and drops to over 150ft .  You have to watch your depth and keep an eye on your dive computers .  We normally try to stay between 40 and 70 ft .  Due to the currents and surges we see many schools of fish and a good chance for mantas and also whale sharks . nnwww . sirenasdivingcostarica . comnnMoseying around  .  .  .  mirando a todos los peces y estamos buceando en Bajo Negro ,  Isla Murciu00E9lagos .

__label__poor Whale experts call for rethink of global shipping routes to stop marine giants becoming u2018roadkillu2019 In a new report ,  researchers from Macquarie University are calling for a rethink of global shipping routes ,  to protect whales and sharks from becoming marine u2018roadkillu2019 . More than 10 billion metric tons of goods travel by sea each year ,  making up 80 per cent of the worldu2019s merchandise trade . The continual growth of the shipping trade and rebounding of some whale populations post-whaling is leading to increasing clashes between cargo ships and marine giants . Melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through previously untouched whale habitats . Marine megafauna like Great Whales ,  whale sharks and basking sharks are particularly vulnerable to ships because of their size ,  migration routes and the whalesu2019 need to travel close to the surface for air . Deadly ship strikes are not the only threat to the animals ,  with vessel noise disrupting whalesu2019 delicate communication ,  and chemical pollution and heavily used routes fragmenting habitats . Whale researcher Vanessa Pirotta from Macquarie Universityu2019s Department of Biological Sciences said lessons from the wildlife impacts of roads could be applied to the ocean ,  to prevent marine giants becoming u2018roadkillu2019 . u201CNew shipping routes through whale habitat put vulnerable species at risk ,  and this study provides a new understanding of how to mitigate shipping traffic impacts on these marine giants , u201D Ms Pirotta said . The reportu2019s authors propose limiting the creation of new shipping routes in areas such as the Arctic and broadening shipping exclusion zones to take into account the impact of ships beyond the marine roads themselves ,  such as noise pollution and chemical contamination . Designing cleaner and quieter ships would reduce the risk of oil spills and chemical pollution and reduce underwater noise . In addition ,  implementing speed limits and detours around whale habitats at certain times of year would mitigate some of the negative consequences . Ms Pirotta said: u201CNew technologies can accurately monitor whale populations and behaviour ,  and if combined with data about shipping routes and intensity ,  could provide a clearer picture of their interaction . u201CLooking at the impacts of roads on wildlife populations can then help predict what might happen if the shipping industry continues to expand ,  and this can inform better management plans to protect our marine giants . u201DPirotta ,  V .  , Grech ,  A .  , Jonsen ,  I .  , Laurance ,  W . and Harcourt ,  R .

__label__poor Sharks Processing Factory In China A horrific look behind the scenes of the dietary supplement and bogus traditional Chinese medicine industry in Puqi ,  Zhejiang Province ,  China .  Workers are seen chopping up the sharks and manta rays in unsanitary conditions that resemble a real charnel house .  Many types of sharks are slaughtered in their thousands annually ,  then boiled up to remove the cartilage then ground to a powder for glucosamine sulphate and chondroitin joint repair dietary supplements .  These health products are used by millions of people across the globe daily for bad elbows and knees .  The filthy carnage seen on the floor of this factory would have been exported and sold in Europe ,  America and Asia .  Manta ray gill rakers are used as a newly concocted bogus traditional Chinese medicine .  WildLifeRisk is calling on the Chinese government to enact tougher wildlife protection legislation ,  and is pushing for greater enforcement of existing laws .  WildLifeRisk is also calling on the public worldwide to refrain from consuming supposed health products such as Omega 3 fish oil  ( actually derived from whale shark liver oil ,  or squalene )  and glucosamine sulphate or chondroitin joint repair dietary supplements which both contain shark-related products .

In general ,  hymns in the central text of the Sikhs ,  the Guru Granth Sahib ,  are called Gurbani .  Among Amrit dhari Sikhs ,  a few texts from Dasam Granth which are read as Nitnem ,  like Tav-Prasad Savaiye and Chaupai ,  are also considered Gurbani .  In Adi Granth ,  Gurbani is a sound which comes directly from the Supreme and the text is a written form of the same in worldly language and scripts .  It is also called Gun Bani . [1] Gurbani are explanations of qualities of the Primal Lord and Soul which a Sikh should comprehend and with which he can attain the supreme state . nnSikh historical writings ,  unauthentic writings or apocryphal compositions written under the names of Sikh Gurus and other writings by Sikhs are not considered Gurbani and are referred to as Kachi Bani .

__label__poor Divers explore the magical underwater world of Roatu00E1n ,  Honduras Roatu00E1n is one of Hondurasu2019s Caribbean Bay Islands .  Being part of the huge Mesoamerican Barrier Reef ,  it is known for its beautiful white sand beaches ,  scuba diving sites and marine life ,  including whale sharks .  In the southwest is busy West Bay Beach ,  with a coral reef near the shore which is where Brent and Elsa found themselves on this day in November 2018 .  Boarding a panga boat in west bay they scooted to the very near dive site called ZIGZAG .  Descending below the waves brought Brent and Elsa an amazing dive with some gorgeous creatures common in the area . nnAlthough Roatan is a small island it offers up more than 30 dive sites around its perimeter .  Intriguing names such as Turtle Crossing ,  Spooky Channel and Green Outhouse Reef are just a few of the dive locations you will find around the reef .  Thinking about exploring Honduras Bay Islands and possibly specifically Roatan ?  The first explorer in history to land here was Christopher Columbus in 1502 .  He was not the first one there though ,  the people known as the Paya Indians are known to have inhabited these beautiful islands back as far as 600 AD .  Whether a scuba diving enthusiast or someone that just loves to travel and explore ,  Roatan has a lot to offer for such a small island . nnNot a snorkeler or diver ?  The west bay has some great shops offering up some beautiful handmade treasures or sit on the gorgeous sandy beaches and enjoy a cold drink with your toes in the Caribbean waters .  Are you a daredevil ?  Take in a jet ski tour racing through the local bays .  You can also get harnessed up for a speedy slide on the zip lines at Monkey Trail Canopy at Gumbalimba Park .  Foodie ?  Well there are definitely some great restaurants and beach side bars offering up some local treats of seafood and a local specialty called Baleadas .  These are homemade flour tortillas filled with beans and cheese and are just $1 !  Try them with avocado ,  eggs ,  chicken or meat . nnSource & embed code: https: /  / rumble . com / v6xscs-divers-explore-the-magical-underwater-world-of-roatan-honduras . html . nnFor licensing ,  please email licensing@rumble . com .

The wreck has been completely colonised by coral during the 50 years that it has spent in the Tulamben waters .  During almost 20 years ,  it was simply stranded on the beach and rusted ,  the paint freeing itself bit by bit from the steel plates .  The marine paint having been made to avoid the formation of life ,  coral and algae ,  many wrecks where the paint has remained relatively intact in the world have not been able to be colonised by as much coral ,  which makes the Liberty wreck unique .  We can find multicoloured gorgonias of a couple of meters at a depth of 12 and 14 meters ,  on the front section of the ship .  Life is everywhere on the wreck !  You will see humphead parrot fish ,  schools of trevally ,  Leaf scorpion fish ,  pygmee sea horses ,  giant barracuda ,  frog fish ,  groupers ,  jack fish ,  angel fish ,  black tip and white tip sharks .  If you are very lucky you may even encounter a whale shark ,  an eagle ray or even a Mola ! nnnThanks for the music tracks to:nBoards -  Francis PrevenNew Land - ALBISnSt .

__label__poor Amazing Facts ,  Animal Life ,  19 The hammerhead sharks are named for the unusual and distinctive structure of their heads .  Unlike most sharks ,  hammerheads usually swim in schools during the day ,  becoming solitary hunters at night . nnThe megamouth shark is an extremely rare species of deep water shark ,  swam at a depth of around 120 - 160m during day & at nights at depths of between 12 & 25m . nnThe whale shark is a slow-moving filter feeding shark & is the worlds largest shark at about 20m long ,  but it is a harmless giant . nnTiger sharks are apex predators & they eat almost anything ,  which includes tyres ,  bottles ,  clothes ,  human flesh etc . nnThe Japanese spider crab has the greatest leg span of any arthropod ,  reaching 3 . 8m from claw to claw .  The body may grow to a size of 40cm and the whole crab can weigh up to 19kg . nnThe dresser crab or decorator crab usually found covered in seaweed ,  sponges & other sea creatures that acts as a camouflage . nnEvery year in the Christmas Island ,  roads are forced to be closed because of a massive migration of red crabs . nnScorpions glow in the dark & look neon blue if seen it in the moon light . nnThe Eurasian reed warbler is one of the species that are brood parasitized  ( rely on others to raise their young )  ,  by common cuckoo . nnThe colourful and large bill ,  which is some large species measures more than half the length of the body ,  is the hallmark of toucans . nnSociable weaver birds build large compound community nests ,  a rarity among birds & the nest measures about 20ft wide and 10ft high . nnRuppells griffon vulture - the highest flying bird ever ,  has been found at heights up to 11 , 300m  ( 37 , 000 ft )  . nnThere are about 18 species of penguin ,  most of them living in huge colonies called Rookeries along the coast of Antarctica & nearby islands . nnAlex - an African grey parrot ,  learned to count ,  sort out shapes & say more than 100 words ,  but died in 2007 ,  at the age of 31  ( average life span for African grey parrots is 60 years )  . nnLacking teeth ,  ostriches swallow pebbles to grind their food and an adult ostrich carries about 1 kg of stones in its stomach . nnKookaburra is the terrestrial tree kingfishers native to Australia and New Guinea & its loud call sounds like echoing human laughter . nnMushrooms such as Stinkhorns spores has a smell of rotting meat or even poo ,  which attract flies and other insects to help disperse the spores . nnFungi can grow in soil ,  on old wood ,  around baths or on our feet & toenails . nnA frogs two front legs have four toes each ,  while the back legs have five toes each . nnGoliath Frog lacks a vocal sac and so cannot make any sound . nnOctopuses are the first invertebrates to be seen using tools ,  such as using coconut shells to hide from potential predators . nnThe mimic octopus possesses the unique behaviour of taking shape of various animals such as flatfish ,  jellyfish ,  stingray ,  seahorse or deadly sea snake . nnOctopuses have three hearts .  Two branchial hearts pump blood through each of the two gills ,  while the third is a systemic heart that pumps blood through the body . nnAn octopus can open a screw-top bottle or jar with its tentacles . nnWandering albatrosses spend most of their life in flight ,  landing only to breed and feed .  Distances travelled each year are hard to measure ,  but one banded bird was recorded travelling 6000 km in twelve days . nnThe brown skua also known as the Antarctic skua is a large seabird that breeds in the sub Antarctic and Antarctic zones ,  eats penguin eggs and even trash . nnThe ribbon-tailed astrapia is medium-sized only up to 32 cm long ,  but it has the longest tail than any other bird at 1 m long . nnArctic birds keep warm by standing on one leg & tucking their head under a wing . nnThe most obvious characteristic of the flatfish is its asymmetry ,  with both eyes lying on the same side of the head in the adult fish .  In some families ,  the eyes are usually on the right side of the body and in others ,  they are usually on the left . nnA flying fish spent 45 seconds in a single flight & the flights are typically around 50m .  They can use updrafts at the leading edge of waves to cover distances of up to 400m at speeds of more than 70 km / hr & at the maximum altitude is 6m above the surface of the sea .

__label__good sharks protect sharks marine policy suggest that around 100 million sharks are killed every year by humans .  this number might be vast beyond comprehension but the journal also recognises that it is a conservative estimate and it could by closer to 273 million killed each year .  taking the 100 million estimate  it works out at 11 416 sharks killed across the globe every single hour .   ( metro . co . uk )   shark killing has to end because  .  .  . as apex predators  sharks play an important role in the ecosystem by maintaining the species below them in the food chain and serving as an indicator for ocean health .  they help remove the weak and the sick as well as keeping the balance with competitors helping to ensure species diversity .  by taking sharks out of the coral reef ecosystem  the larger predatory fish  such as groupers  increase in abundance and feed on the herbivores .  with less herbivores  macroalgae expands and coral can no longer compete  shifting the ecosystem to one of algae dominance  affecting the survival of the reef system .

This morning ,  millions of tiny baby Christmas Island red crabs have started to drift up onto the shoreline around this incredible island !  A month ago ,  the adult crabs all spawned billions of eggs into the sea ,  and these little guys have been drifting around in the oceanu2019s currents hoping that they donu2019t get eaten by lurking whale sharks and also hoping that this will be one of the years when the currents miraculously bring them back to the island just as they start to transform from free-swimming little Megalopes into mini crabs !  These guys are the lucky survivors ,  clambering ashore to head up into the jungle to live out their lives as land crabs ,  cleaning the forest floor .  After they mature in about 5 years ,  these guys will join the 50-million adult red crabs in their annual migration down to the sea to spawn ,  in a spectacular event Sir David Attenborough describes as one of the Top 10 natural wonders on Earth .  Maybe visit next Dec / Jan / Feb and stay at the luxurious new eco-retreat Swell Lodge on the coast inside the national park to be right in the heart of this extraordinary event !

__label__good enormous whale shark descends through divers from above scuba divers from all around the world consider the galapagos islands to be one of their bucket list travel destinations .  there are many reasons that they feel the allure of this world .  it could be the hammerheads that congregate in enormous schools  the sea turtles in abundance  the harsh  yet beautiful landscape that has caused such unique adaptations in the animal life .  for many  it is the chance to see whale sharks  the biggest shark in the ocean and one of the largest animals alive .  the galapagos provide a very real possibility of encountering one or two .  the three distinct ocean currents that converge here bring an abundance of food and create ideal conditions for whale sharks during certain months .   imagine the dream coming true for these divers as they are carried along on the current  exploring the waters around darwin island  one of the most iconic locations in the world .  a large shadow appeared over their heads and they realized that not only were they seeing one of the majestic beasts above  but she was descending right toward them .  she is a large  pregnant female  over fifty feet in length .  possibly curious  possibly somehow aware of their admiration  she circles slowly as she dives  passing through their bubbles and among the group .  some of the divers had ascended to 60 feet  as the dive was nearing its end .  others remained at eighty feet .  incredibly  this whale shark spiraled downward  giving them all a breathtaking view as she did so .  from the cameramanu2019s point of view  the divers below were only partially visible but their bubbles show their position and the whale shark can be seen gracefully passing by them .   the divers below couldnu2019t resist and they sank slowly with her  prolonging the encounter as much as they could .  for a scuba diver  such a meeting is unforgettable and extremely emotional .   source & embed code: https: /  / rumble . com / v6vusm-whale-shark-descends-through-divers . html .   for licensing  please email licensing@rumble . com .

__label__poor [unknown] Snorkeling: MANTA RAYS are simply majestic creatures  ( Nusa Penida - Bali ) nnSnorkeling with manta rays is truely an experience you should not miss in Bali .  It is so incredible how these big creatures fly in the water .  You can book a manta ray snorkeling tour anywhere .  Yet you should know that the snorkeling is at the coast Nusa Penida ,  an island very close to Bali .  Actually many instagram photos are from here ! nWhen you see the film ,  you will notice all the stuff floating in the water .  It is not all trash ,  but still way too much .  I think it is important that people can see theses majestic animals but on the other hand may be they should clean up as well when they dive into the water world .

__label__poor 7 Unanswered Questions About Sharks 7 Unanswered Questions About Sharks:wildlife discovery . nnwildlife videos:https: /  / youtu . be / QuCfGfTkl-snn7 Unanswered Questions About SharksnnShark mysteriesnAsk any shark biologist a question about sharks ,  and chances are ,  the answer will begin with ,  Were not really sure ,  butu2026nThats because researchers know remarkably little about these deep-ocean creatures .  There are more than 400 species of shark ,  and many of them fare poorly in captivity ,  making it difficult to observe their mating ,  navigational ,  learning and social  ( or anti-social )  behavior . nIn celebration of the Discovery Channels Shark Week ,  here are seven mysteries that scientists have yet to solve about sharks . nn1 )  How do sharks navigate ? nThe open ocean has few visual cues ,  so how do sharks know where theyre going ?  Some sharks travel great distances ,  such as the great white sharks that swim across the Indian Ocean ,  from the west coast of Australia to South Africa ,  said Andrew Nosal ,  a postdoctoral researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the Birch Aquarium . nIt is an enduring mystery how sharks find their way through the ocean ,  which environmental cues they use ,  and how exactly those cues are detected and integrated ,  Nosal told Live Science . nThere is compelling evidence that some sharks use geomagnetic navigation ,  meaning that they can sense Earths magnetic field ,  orient to it and use it as a navigational tool ,  he said .  Olfaction  ( smell )  may be another navigational tool that some sharks use .  But perhaps other factors u2014 such as water temperature ,  sound and even vision  ( to some extent )  u2014 may help sharks navigate the deep ,  Nosal said . nn2 )  How many species exist ? nResearchers are still discovering new species of shark ,  especially from the deep ocean . nThese habitats are so mysterious because they are so removed from human activity ,  Nosal said .  We still dont know what lives there . nFor instance ,  the so-called ninja shark  ( Etmopterus benchleyi )  was announced to the scientific world in December 2015; a newfound species of hammerhead shark  ( Sphyrna gilberti )  off the coast of South Carolina was identified in 2013; and a new species of walking shark  ( Hemiscyllium halmahera )  ,  shown here ,  made headlines after researchers discovered it in a reef off an Indonesian island ,  according to a 2013 study in the Journal of Ichthyology . nMoreover ,  sharks can range greatly in size ,  from as small as a cigar to as large as a school bus  ( such as the whale shark ,  a plankton feeder )  .  They also live in diverse habitats ,  so a newfound species could be uncovered anywhere ,  Nosal said . nn3 )  Why do sharks migrate ? nIts clear that many sharks migrate seasonally ,  different trackers show .  But why these fish migrate is still a mystery . nWeve got great technology that tells us where they are going ,  said Gregory Skomal ,  a fisheries biologist with the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries .  But we dont know what drives the migration . nDo sharks migrate for food ,  mating ,  temperature or perhaps a mixture of all three ?  Its hard to say ,  even after studying a handful of sharks within the same species ,  Nosal said . nI might track 10 leopard sharks ,  and they all do something thats a little bit different ,  Nosal said .  Its hard to pull out the patterns to explain whats going on . nOnly by studying vast numbers of a single species of shark can researchers find overall trends and perhaps tease out the reasons behind each migration ,  he said .  .  . nnAccording to Live Science . nnThank you for watching ! nnDont forget to like this video ,  and subscribe for the next video . nn#researchsciences [Unanswered , Questions , Sharks , science daily , science articles , interesting science articles , 21 news , news information knowledge , news documentary , endtime news update today , end times news , breaking news today , 21 news channel and friends , 21 new channel , community news , today , news , knowledge , science

We boarded a 7 day scuba liveaboard and set off towards the atolls .  The scenery was blue in all directions and light turquoise around the island protected reefs .  There were thousands of islands ,  each one more picturesque then the one we just left .  We had some rain and rough seas ,  but that didnu2019t really effect our dives since we were underwater .  Also ,  we are about a month out of season ,  which is why we were able to afford this deeply discounted ship .  All in all we did so many dives for us that it would be almost too much .

__label__good the biggest fish in the sea  the whaleshark  ( rhincodon typus )   koh tao  thailand .  the whale shark  ( rhincodon typus )  is a slow-moving  filter-feeding carpet shark and the largest known extant fish species .  the largest confirmed individual had a length of 12 . 65 m  ( 41 . 5 ft )  and a weight of about 21 . 5 t  ( 47 000 lb )  .  the whale shark holds many records for size in the animal kingdom  most notably being by far the largest living nonmammalian vertebrate .  it is the sole member of the genus rhincodon and the only extant member of the family rhincodontidae which belongs to the subclass elasmobranchii in the class chondrichthyes .  before 1984 it was classified as rhiniodon into rhinodontidae .   the whale shark is found in open waters of the tropical oceans and is rarely found in water below 21 u00B0c  ( 70 u00B0f )  . [2] modeling suggests a lifespan of about 70 years  but measurements have proven difficult . [9] whale sharks have very large mouths and are filter feeders  which is a feeding mode that occurs in only two other sharks  the megamouth shark and the basking shark .  they feed almost exclusively on plankton and small fishes  and pose no threat to humans .   cjeck out my facebook & instaggram for more photos & videos .  https: /  / www . facebook . com / videoandphotowtc /  https: /  / www . instagram . com / wtc . productions /  [whalehark rhincodon typus koh tao scuba diving koh tao diving koh tao diving schools diving school scuba diving certification scuba diving course diving lessons scuba shop diving certification diving in thailand padi courses dive shop koh tao ko tao koh tao thailand scuba diving scuba what is scuba diving best diving in thailand diving big blue diving koh thai padi koh phangan big blue bigblue thailand koh tao

__label__poor Amazing Experience With Humpback Whales Exmouth 2017 With Nigaloo Whale Shark Swim Tours When we swam with the whales my GoPro decided to stop functioning so unfortunately ,  I was unable to get footage from under the water .  However ,  we did manage to capture some incredible footage from the boat . nnWe experienced a mother and calf trapped in an epic battle with two giant males ,  at times within just a few meters from the boat .  This lasted maybe 30 minutes or longer but was hard to tell with all of the excitement . nnSwimming with the whales was an unforgettable experience but this absolutely made the trip worthwhile for me .  A big thanks to all of the team at Ningaloowhalesharks . com for an incredible day and great company . nnMusic by www . bensound . com [humpback whales , swimming , humpback , whalesharks , whale shark , whale , exmouth , swimming with humpback whales , ningaloo , experience , travel , australia , traveling australia , ocean , snorkelling , snorkeling , travelling , travelling australia

__label__good swimming with my whale shark family .  .  .  sorry for the unclear 360 4k footage you need to move the screen around to see the whales .  .  .   -----  finally got to meet up with some aquatic family in the gulf of mexico this past trip .  . was wild .   as we headed out dolphins suddenly appeared by our boat swimming alongside us  ( you can one jumping at the very beginning )  .   we circled for an hour but the two whale sharks were feeding down below and werent surfacing until the very end .  then we jumped in two by two !   these are enormous creatures  look at the size of us by them !  on my way back to the boat my swim partner called out  look hes right under us and i dived back in .   sure enough he was basking with his massive mouth wide open and had come straight behind us following our trail back to the boat .  my camera was literally in his mouth and i had to pull back so as to stay circling him .   ( of course i panicked and hit the record button again so that switched off the video and you cant see how close he came to me .  . duh  sorry about that )  .   the two sharks hung around really relaxed in our company; it was majestic .   ---  whale sharks have unique spots on their backs and bellies similar to human fingerprints making each individual identifiable .  they are not a mammal as whales are  but the largest fish in the ocean  laying eggs rather than birthing live young as whales do .  the term shark comes from the shape of the fins and their bodies but technically they are closer to filter feeding whales at 40 feet long rather than carnivorous sharks .   --  music by christopher comstock https: /  / www . reverbnation . com / chrisvcomstock [whale sharks the gypsie princess scuba divers snorkeling stargate swimming aquatic marine life gulf of mexico chris comstock

__label__good nature guide makes dream come true for scuba diver tour guests imagine meeting not one whale shark face to face  but twelve !  these scuba divers have traveled from canada to the galapagos islands for the trip of a lifetime .  they embarked on a 7 day voyage aboard the galapagos sky  a tour boat that would take them to one of the most remote  hostile  and challenging environments on the planet .  it is also one of the most beautiful places on earth .  they were hoping for a sighting of a whale shark  the most massive and majestic shark in the ocean .  it is the biggest fish and also the biggest animal in the world  with the exception of a few species of whale .  they are beautiful creatures and despite their intimidating size  they are harmless and gentle .  for a scuba diver  there is no greater experience than to swim with a whale shark .  these divers were about to experience something beyond their wildest dreams .  the tourists were under the guidance of christian rueda  a very experienced and talented nature guide and scuba diver .  they are seasoned adventurers  but they needed specific training about how to dive in the strong currents in the galapagos .  it took christian several days of intense instruction to increase their skills to the point that they were ready for these dives .  entering the water in rough waves and strong current is not for the faint of heart .  after investing so much in this trip  christian understandably felt a lot of pressure to provide them with the view of a whale shark they were hoping for .  as they braved the waters around darwin island  christian was faced with the biggest challenge .  actually finding these whale sharks is often a nearly impossible task .  studying the conditions carefully  he chose the time and the spot and led the divers to a rock ledge under darwins arch  70 feet below the surface .  incredibly  one of the massive creatures appeared on the second day .  christian had the divers lined up on the wall to watch and wait .  surrounded by hammerhead sharks  sea turtles and fish  it was like watching the most massive and spectacular imax screen .  when the whale shark slowly cruised past on the ocean current  the divers followed their guide out into the blue to meet it face to face .  what they saw and felt when they came close enough to touch this majestic animal cannot be described .  for the next five days  christian found his guests whale sharks 11 more times .  their experience in the waters of the galapagos islands left them in awe .  this video provides us with a few highlights from their adventure .  few people have ever met one of these creatures close up and even fewer have met 12 in one week .   source & embed code: https: /  / rumble . com / v71dre-scuba-divers-have-dream-encounter-with-whale-sharks-in-galapagos-islands . html .   for licensing  please email licensing@rumble . com .

__label__poor Whale Shark Passes Nearby ,  Oslob ,  Cebu Island ,  Philippines Short clip of a whale shark swimming through a dive group in Oslob ,  Philippines . nnThere is a wee bit of controversy surrounding the sharks in this area ,  as they are fed by locals in order to attract them to boats for tourists .  The food apparently isnt sufficient for the whale sharks needs ,  and the constant supply of food stops them from migrating properly .  I went along with a dive group to see the process in action ,  and I cannot recommend going on one of these tourist boats if you care about the welfare of these creatures . nnPlease also be careful of which dive company you chose to go with ,  some genuinely care about the sharks and will use the larger proportion of your dive fee to help with the conservation of sharks .  Other dive companies are less concerned with the sharks wellbeing .  [Whale Shark , diving , oslob , philippines , scuba , cebu island , shark

__label__poor Brave Rhino Tries to Withstand the Elephant - Wild Animals Fighting Rhino meets elephants and tries to prove that he is the owner of the territory .  What will be the outcome ? nnA rhinoceros ,  often abbreviated to rhino ,  is one of any five extant species of odd-toed ungulates in the family Rhinocerotidae ,  as well as any of the numerous extinct species .  Two of these extant species are native to Africa and three to Southern Asia .  Members of the rhinoceros family are characterized by their large size  ( they are some of the largest remaining megafauna ,  with all of the species able to reach one tonne or more in weight ) ; as well as by an herbivorous diet; a thick protective skin ,  1 . 5u20135 cm thick ,  formed from layers of collagen positioned in a lattice structure; relatively small brains for mammals this size  ( 400u2013600 g ) ; and a large horn .  They generally eat leafy material ,  although their ability to ferment food in their hindgut allows them to subsist on more fibrous plant matter ,  if necessary .  Unlike other perissodactyls ,  the two African species of rhinoceros lack teeth at the front of their mouths ,  relying instead on their lips to pluck food .  Rhinoceros are killed by humans for their horns ,  which are bought and sold on the black market ,  and which are used by some cultures for ornamental or traditional medicinal purposes .  East Asia ,  specifically Vietnam ,  is the largest market for rhino horns .  By weight ,  rhino horns cost as much as gold on the black market .  People grind up the horns and then consume them believing the dust has therapeutic properties .  The horns are made of keratin ,  the same type of protein that makes up hair and fingernails .  Both African species and the Sumatran rhinoceros have two horns ,  while the Indian and Javan rhinoceros have a single horn . nnElephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea .  Two species are traditionally recognised ,  the African elephant and the Asian elephant ,  although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species .  Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa ,  South Asia ,  and Southeast Asia .  Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other ,  now extinct ,  members of the order include deinotheres ,  gomphotheres ,  mammoths ,  and mastodons .  Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of 4 m  ( 13 ft )  and weigh 7 , 000 kg  ( 15 , 000 lb )  .  All elephants have several distinctive features ,  the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis ,  used for many purposes ,  particularly breathing ,  lifting water ,  and grasping objects .  Their incisors grow into tusks ,  which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging .  Elephants large ear flaps help to control their body temperature .  Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight .  African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs .  Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs ,  forests ,  deserts ,  and marshes .  They prefer to stay near water .  They are considered to be keystone species due to their impact on their environments .  Other animals tend to keep their distance from elephants while predators ,  such as lions ,  tigers ,  hyenas ,  and wild dogs ,  usually target only young elephants  ( or calves )  .  Females  ( cows )  tend to live in family groups ,  which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring .  The groups are led by an individual known as the matriarch ,  often the oldest cow .  Elephants have a fissionu2013fusion society in which multiple family groups come together to socialise .  Males  ( bulls )  leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males .  Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth ,  which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success .  Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years .  Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild . nnAll information according to www . wikipedia . orgnnBison vs Grizzly Bear vs Moose vs Elk vs Deer vs Buffalo vs Wolf vs Bull vs Lion vs Tiger vs Elephant vs Giraffe vs Rhino vs Gorilla vs Whale vs Shark vs Panther vs Python vs Anaconda vs Jaguar vs Boar vs Walrus vs Polar Bear vs Hyena vs Warthog vs Hippo vs Wolves vs Wolfpack vs Cobra vs Mongoose vs Alligator vs Yak vs Piranha .

__label__poor Discover Scuba Diving Thailand - Programme 4 - Koh Samui ,  Koh Tao ,  Chumphon Enjoy a broad overview on diving locations ,  facilities ,  accommodations ,  and further activities for your perfect diving vacation to Thailand on the new multi-lingual DVD .  See ,  where you can meet whale sharks ,  manta rays ,  turtles ,  ghost pipe fishes ,  or dive into wrecks . nWe examined the most beautiful dive spots for you  ( see the Thailand Map for an overview )  and took all videos at the original locations ourselves: There is no old stuff .  shapeimage_1_link_0nIn addition ,  we visited lots of facilities and met instructors and divers ,  evaluated accommodations ,  and found other activities interesting for your holidays ,  that we truly can recommend - we awarded them the Dive Club Thailand Seal . nBesides the videos from the original locations  ( in English ,  German ,  Russian ,  Japanese ,  Finnish ,  and Swedish )  ,  all this information is included in the supplemental Information Booklet  ( in English )  with all the addresses for your direct contact . nOn this Website ,  you get an overview of the four programmes the DVD contains  ( South Thailand ,  East Thailand ,  Andaman Sea ,  and Gulf of Thailand )  .  As you will see ,  it is made by enthusiastic divers for both experienced divers and those who just want to learn it . nAdditionally ,  we offer the contacts and addresses for those who know all these beautiful diving locations in Thailand and enjoyed snorkelling ,  scuba diving ,  technical diving  ,  and the enormous variety of marine life in Thailand already . nnThe final programme on the DVD takes you to the beautiful islands in the southern Gulf of Thailand .  Koh Tao ,  Koh Samui and Koh Phangan have been visited by tourists for many years and never fail to satisfy  .  .  .  with powder white sandy beaches and turquoise blue waters . nEach island has something different to offer  .  .  .  Koh Tao is more laid back without much development it is the backpackers dream .  Koh Samui and Koh Phangan have received a little more investment and developed over recent times but it is still possible to find your own secluded beach . nWe show you each of the islands and the dive sites which can be found around each .  Chumphon is around 520 km south of Bangkok but only 2 hours by boat from Koh Tao and is the eco tourists dream . nVery little development has been made here and the forests and rivers inland are flowing with flora and fauna .  Chumphon has a number of local islands which have very little diving over the years yet ,  which offer the diver the opportunity to see several marine critters like Sea Horses ,  Frog Fish and Cleaner Shrimps . nAs shown in the DVD we think Chumphon and the Islands make excellent destinations for those people who want to learn to dive ,  with its combination of good visibility and shallower dive sites its the perfect place to gain your confidence .

Youu2019d be amazed every time you caught something ,  and your parents would act impressed ,  too ,  even if it was smaller than your palm .  At the time youu2019d find it hard to believe that there were creatures in the ocean bigger than that .  Obviously ,  now that youu2019ve grown older ,  youu2019re aware of some of the huge beasts that grace our seas .  Of course ,  thereu2019s the blue whale or the great white shark ,  but have you ever considered some of the lesser-known creatures out there ? nnWeu2019ve put together a list of some of the biggest living things youu2019ll find in the ocean u2013 although theyu2019re not necessarily all things you would like to catch .  For example ,  you most definitely do not want to come across a Giant Spider Crab while paddling at the shore ,  although chance would be a fine thing ,  as they donu2019t tend to swim to the surface .  Or what about the Fin Whale ?  A far friendlier giant ,  itu2019s one you should try and see in your lifetime u2013 if it doesnu2019t get hunted into extinction anytime soon . nnIf youu2019re venturing further afield ,  and happen to be in Antarctica ,  you might be lucky enough to be greeted by a Southern Elephant Seal .  Youu2019ll be surprised to find out why itu2019s named that ,  too .  Some other interesting beasts in our video include the Lionu2019s Mane Jellyfish ,  the Oceanic Manta Ray and the Whale Shark ,  but youu2019ll have to watch the video to find out the rest .

__label__poor World biggest shark / whale world bigges shark The whale shark  ( Rhincodon typus )  is a slow-moving filter-feeding carpet shark and the largest known extant fish species .  The largest confirmed individual had a length of 12 . 65 m  ( 41 . 5 ft )  and a weight of about 21 . 5 t  ( 47 , 000 lb )  . [3] Unconfirmed claims of considerably larger individuals ,  over 14 m  ( 46 ft )  long and weighing at least 30 t  ( 66 , 000 lb )  ,  are not uncommon . [citation needed] The whale shark holds many records for sheer size in the animal kingdom ,  most notably being by far the largest living nonmammalian vertebrate .  It is the sole member of the genus Rhincodon and the only extant member of the family Rhincodontidae  ( called Rhiniodon and Rhinodontidae before 1984 )  ,  which belongs to the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes .  The species originated about 60 million years ago .

It is here that Oxford traveled to u2013 Cenderawasih Bay off the Province of Papua and West Papua .

__label__poor 5 extinct animals captured in camera and seen in real life !  5 extinct animals captured on camera in real life description: extinction has been a controversial subject since it was suggested by scientists in the 19th century .  in the time elapsed since then  the evidence has come to show that extinction might not be so permanent after all .  with this said these are 5 extinct animals captured on camera and seen in real life .   .  .  .  .  ready ?  ?   .  .  .  start .  .  .  !  ! nn1 .  dinosaur in africa while the rest of the animals have lived recently  this animal lived millions of years ago .  a tribe in the republic of congo was reportedly captured by a velociraptor in the jungle  which they proudly put on display .  while the dinosaurs allegedly became extinct 65 million years ago  some people believe that the small populations continued to survive in the deepest and darkest desert  far from human contact .  sometimes it is believed that these possible survivors are the origin of dragons  snakes and other great monsters of human mythology .  it may be possible that something undiscovered and unexplained continue to prosper in the 500 million hectares of rainforest in the congo that inspired the story of joseph conrad heart of darkness . nn2 .  the whale omura the omura whale is a species of whale recently discovered originally in the years 2000 by a japanese researcher .  it was discovered through dna analysis found in the whale bones at the bottom of the ocean in the years 90 .  it was believed that the whale  which had hitherto been undiscovered  was extinguished .  it was later discovered that the bones belonged to a dwarf fin or pygmy whale that was rarely seen across asia . nn3 .  mammoth wooly mammoth wooly is believed to have been hunted to extinction by man during the ice age .  while their relatives survived to become a modern asian elephant  mammoths are theorized to have been dead 10 000 years ago .  some have theorized that the woolly mammoths continued to live and existed in cold regions where they were safe from humans and warmer temperatures .  they believe that the preserved and mummified corpses of mammoths found in these areas could be evidence of this  and sightings of mammoths have been reported in the wild .  this video captures one of those sightings like a wooly mammoth allegedly tries to cross a frozen river in a forest in siberia . nn4 .  tasmanian tiger the tasmanian tiger was a carnivorous marsupial that emigrateded australia before it died .  it is also known as the wolf tasmano  despite having no relationship with wolves or tigers  due to its appearance of dog and tiger-striped .  the tasmanian tigers were already rare before the british settlers arrived  and they believed they had died out on the island of australia  although the species continued to live on the island of tasmania from which it took its name .  due to a combination of excessive hunting and habitat invasion  this creature would have been extinguished in the 1990s  when the last wild tasmanian tiger was killed in 1930 .  on the other hand .  there have always been rumors about this subject .  .  and this video captures a tasmanian tiger in australia .  go .  .  . nn5 .  megalodon the myths about big fish as sea monsters are universal to human conditions .  the best known may be the legend of the leviathan  an ancient and giant fish or whale who ate the biblical figure job .  although traditionally it was believed that the leviathan had been a whale  the discovery of the ancient and supposedly extinct megalodon shark led people to believe that perhaps the inspiration for leviathan had originally been a giant shark .  while it is believed that the megalodonios are extinct  only 5% of the ocean has been explored and day-to-day biologists discover new species of creatures and even rediscover species that were previously considered extinct .  it is not impossible that an evolutionary return to the megalodon can continue to exist .  this giant shark was captured by the japanese marine biologists in 2016 background music: kevin macleod-kevin macleod music of the end: for copyright subjects  do not hesitate to send me an email here: officialamerikano@hotmail . com _____ ______ _____ .  .  .  __________ .  .  .  .  __________ thank you very much for watching this video .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  give like if you liked this video [animals  creatures  strangers  real life  captured in camera  captured in video  captured in camara  extinct animals  that could revive  in camera  viral  real  strange animals  captured  monsters  megalodon  strangers animals   extinction   extinct animals   live animals   extinct creatures   captured in camera   captured in video   captured   extinct animals that could remain alive   captured   extinct   animals found alive   captured

__label__good whale sharks of oslob whale shark dive at oslob .   obviously a bit of a controversial place to dive  its basically a fish tank - i tried my best to crop out the approx .  100 snorkellers from the video !  didnt really know the background before we went  ( ie local fishermen feed the sharks -  allegedly this stops them being caught in nets  which the fishermen historically put across the straight  which is a migration route .   however  the sharks are clearly now resident and dont migrate at all  does the huge amount of revenue created go back into conservation ?  allegedly  yes .   would i go back - no .   but there is a part of me that thinks this is no difference to feeding migratory birds in the park .  .  .  )  [whale shark oslob scuba diving kathryn foyle philippenes

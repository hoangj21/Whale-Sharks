(b) a puffer fish has got four very sharp teeth. some puffer fish have got spikes. when it is frightened  a puffer fish drinks a lot of water so it is round and bigger. (c) turtles have got beautiful shells. when they want to lay eggs  they walk very slowly up the beach  dig a hole in the sand and lay their eggs in it. (d) butterfly fish have got beautiful colours and patterns. they live in the coral reef. the other fish cant see them because butterfly can hide in the colourful reefs – then they cant eat them!

_label_poor 'top 5 dinosaur fights and the prehistory that really happened. top 5 dinosaur fights and the prehistory that really happened. summary: the dinosaurs are considered as titanic monsters who once trod the earth. but just as in nature the atmosphere of prehistory was a war zone. where the fighting and the struggle to survive was the daily bread. from clashes between carnivorous and herbivorous dinosaurs to sea-fighting by territory. this time we will review those dinosaur fights and other great rivalries of prehistory that really happened.   number 5: spinosaurus vs carcharodontosaurus. in the 2008 a spinosaurus vertebra was found fractured. no one knew that animal would be able to inflict such damage on him. later the bbc paleontologists claimed that this fracture was caused by a carchadontosaurus. these two dinosaurs would not usually have been found but when the drought affected the environment in which these carnivores lived they faced more than once in fight for food.  number 4: titanoboa vs carbonemis.  colombia 60 million years ago. this was the scene of a fight of superpredators. on one side we have the biggest snake known... the titanoboa. this serpent often disputed its territory with a tortoise that was just as giant... the carbonemys turtle. paleontologists from the university of north carolina claim that this tortoise had a bite so potent that it allowed him to defend himself from their predators and even confront them if necessary. although there is no evidence that the titanoboa and this tortoise have clashed. what we do know is that both fossils were found in the same area.  number 3: t-rex vs triceratops.  the tyrannosaurus rex is known for being one of the most ruthless predators in the cretaceous. it is known that he fed on any living being that crossed his path. however there is a prey that was not so easy to hunt. and it is nothing more and nothing less than the triceratops. tyrannosauruss bite marks on the fossils of triceratops indicate that these two dinosaurs were always struggling for their survival. many times this struggle has been portrayed in popular culture in both films and exhibitions. having the tyrannosaurus some victories and some defeats. without a doubt these two dinosaurs converted the cretaceous period into a battlefield for survival.  number 2: bear of the caverns vs. american lion.  the confrontation between the lion of the caverns and the bear of the caverns. the lion of the caverns named as well because several of his bones were found in the caverns. although it is doubtful that these lions have lived there. from this arises a hypothesis that these lions could have ventured into these caverns in search of bears for their increase. but because the cave bear was a giant that reached a height of 1.3 meters many scientists think that the lion attacked them when they were still hibernating.  number 1: gigantosaurus vs argentinosaurus.  there is evidence that these true titans of prehistory have clashed. on one hand the argentinosaurus a dinosaur with an approximate size of 33 meters in length and the other the gigantosaurus a carnivore of 13 meters long. it has been speculated that the gigantosaurus on multiple occasions hunted these great animals. but to do so the gigantosaurus resorted to the group attacks causing real struggles for survival.     ground zero: megalodon vs livyathan melvillei.  the competition for food in the miocene sea. the miocene was the time when there were two giant predators. on one hand the megalodon and the other the lyviathan melivillei a prehistoric killer whale. these two predators always rivaled food in that miocene sea. it has been said that their constant struggle for food caused one of them to move from their place of home and then possibly become extinct. today  killer whales are known to kill large sharks. is this also happening in prehistory? thinking about dinosaur fights and prehistoric struggles is a fascinating topic. we cant know if it really happened. but what we do know is that prehistory was not a paradise.  powered by: http://swordlord3d.deviantart.com material used in this video: music and effects here: http://bit.ly/2meqfmw animations and videos here: http://bit.ly/2oakqsz you never know that you can find here so follow me: facebook: bit.ly/2aj1v6p dinosaur fights rex dinosaur fights prehistoric animal fights spinosaurus t-rex dinosaurs carnivores spinosaurus vs carcharodontosaurus t-rex vs triceratops giganotosaurus megalodon livyathan livyathan melvillei vs megalodon bear caverns lion cave bear caverns vs. american lion dinosaur prehistory documentaries top 5 minidocumentales topman documentaries in spanish dinosaur videos'

_label_poor 'rescue operation of giant whale shark in seas massive whale shark rescue operation in the ocean समंदर में विशाल व्हेल शार्क का रेस्क्यू ऑपरेशन  massive whale shark rescue operation in the ocean  “my first memory of whale sharks is when i was 10 years old  traveling from mombasa to bombay via porbandar on a ship ” recalls mike pandey  an indian wildlife filmmaker who was born in kenya. he had seen these majestic creatures—the worlds largest fish—swim alongside his ship during the week-long journey in the indian ocean.  decades after  when a middle-aged pandey drove along the gujarat coastline asking people about the “big fish”  which did not have a local name  no one knew what he was talking about. then  in 1996  a builder of fibreglass boats in bhavnagar described the beautifully patterned fish accurately and said that in some villages  people hunted it on occasion. locals did not eat the fish  but they used oil from the liver to waterproof wooden boats.  perhaps the boat-builder was unaware of more recent developments: from 1991 onwards  whale sharks had been killed in large numbers in gujarat  fuelled by the demand for their fins and meat in south-east asia and europe.  in any case  after the chat with the builder  the quest began in earnest. in 1998  pandey sighted his first whale shark in the murky waters of the veraval harbour. as large as a trawler  it lay cut open. two men who had clambered on were hacking at its insides. as life ebbed out of the hapless fish  pandey remembers making a silent pledge: he would save the gentle giants of the gujarat coast.  pandeys crew went about filming the hunting of the whale shark. in 2000  the resulting documentary “shores of silence” won the wildscreen panda award  the equivalent of the oscar for natural history films (watch it here) one year later  after intense lobbying  the indian government banned the killing of whale sharks.  that was not all. in 2002  at a gathering of the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora (cites)  even as the conference was winding down  the panel agreed to a re-vote on whale sharks. after watching pandeys documentary  an overwhelming majority voted to put the fish on a list of species not in immediate danger of extinction  but in need of trade restrictions in order to ensure their survival.  in india  the whale shark was already on a par with the charismatic tiger  as far as legal protection goes. but three years into the ban  a survey along the gujarat coast showed that even in veraval  the hub of the whale shark fisheries  few knew of its status.  a “save the whale sharks” movement was launched in gujarat in 2004  to change attitudes towards the fish that visits its shores from september to may. the campaign was a joint venture of the wildlife trust of india-international fund for animal welfare (wti-ifaw)  tata chemicals ltd and the gujarat forest department.  whale shark  the largest known fish species. photo: venkat charloo morari bapu  a spiritual leader revered by many in gujarat  became a campaign ambassador. at the launch  he spoke about the tradition of non-violence and the idea of honouring guests. warming to the theme  he equated the visits of whale shark to a beloved daughter coming home to give birth to her child.  this metaphor became the theme for a street play which featured a fisherman  a potential hunter of whale sharks  whose pregnant daughter comes home to deliver her baby. the plot linked the fate of the fish and that of the daughter  so ultimately the fisherman resolves to save and protect both.  with the play becoming a hit in the fishing villages  the fish known as “barrel” became vhali  meaning “dear one”  which was the name of the daughter in the play. a 4oft inflatable whale shark  which served as the backdrop  drew in the crowds. inland  too  kids loved the life-sized model of vhali. they touched it and wanted to know more about the fish.  porbandar  the birthplace of mahatma gandhi  was asiatic lion lioness cubs leopard python cat dog dear wildlife animal attack sasan gir girnar flora-fauna forest national park sanctuary mating safari junagadh junagarh gujarat india rescue jambur siddi tribes african license stock footage licensing jungle floods rain biodiversity narendra modi great rare amezing unique lion asian babbar lioness mating cub leopard jungle sasan gir fallen gu narendra modi amazing rare unprecedented unique forest flora fauna junagadh india'

_label_poor '7 unanswered questions about sharks 7 unanswered questions about sharks:wildlife discovery.  wildlife videos:https://youtu.be/qucfgftkl-s  7 unanswered questions about sharks  shark mysteries ask any shark biologist a question about sharks  and chances are  the answer will begin with  were not really sure  but… thats because researchers know remarkably little about these deep-ocean creatures. there are more than 400 species of shark  and many of them fare poorly in captivity  making it difficult to observe their mating  navigational  learning and social (or anti-social) behavior. in celebration of the discovery channels shark week  here are seven mysteries that scientists have yet to solve about sharks.  1) how do sharks navigate? the open ocean has few visual cues  so how do sharks know where theyre going? some sharks travel great distances  such as the great white sharks that swim across the indian ocean  from the west coast of australia to south africa  said andrew nosal  a postdoctoral researcher at the scripps institution of oceanography and the birch aquarium. it is an enduring mystery how sharks find their way through the ocean  which environmental cues they use  and how exactly those cues are detected and integrated  nosal told live science. there is compelling evidence that some sharks use geomagnetic navigation  meaning that they can sense earths magnetic field  orient to it and use it as a navigational tool  he said. olfaction (smell) may be another navigational tool that some sharks use. but perhaps other factors — such as water temperature  sound and even vision (to some extent) — may help sharks navigate the deep  nosal said.  2) how many species exist? researchers are still discovering new species of shark  especially from the deep ocean. these habitats are so mysterious because they are so removed from human activity  nosal said. we still dont know what lives there. for instance  the so-called ninja shark (etmopterus benchleyi) was announced to the scientific world in december 2015; a newfound species of hammerhead shark (sphyrna gilberti) off the coast of south carolina was identified in 2013; and a new species of walking shark (hemiscyllium halmahera)  shown here  made headlines after researchers discovered it in a reef off an indonesian island  according to a 2013 study in the journal of ichthyology. moreover  sharks can range greatly in size  from as small as a cigar to as large as a school bus (such as the whale shark  a plankton feeder). they also live in diverse habitats  so a newfound species could be uncovered anywhere  nosal said.  3) why do sharks migrate? its clear that many sharks migrate seasonally  different trackers show. but why these fish migrate is still a mystery. weve got great technology that tells us where they are going  said gregory skomal  a fisheries biologist with the massachusetts division of marine fisheries. but we dont know what drives the migration. do sharks migrate for food  mating  temperature or perhaps a mixture of all three? its hard to say  even after studying a handful of sharks within the same species  nosal said. i might track 10 leopard sharks  and they all do something thats a little bit different  nosal said. its hard to pull out the patterns to explain whats going on. only by studying vast numbers of a single species of shark can researchers find overall trends and perhaps tease out the reasons behind each migration  he said...  according to live science.  thank you for watching!  dont forget to like this video  and subscribe for the next video.  #researchsciences [unanswered questions sharks science daily science articles interesting science articles 21 news news information knowledge news documentary endtime news update today end times news breaking news today 21 news channel and friends 21 new channel community news today news knowledge science]'

(of course i panicked and hit the record button again so that switched off the video and you cant see how close he came to me..duh  sorry about that).  the two sharks hung around really relaxed in our company; it was majestic.  ---  whale sharks have unique spots on their backs and bellies similar to human fingerprints making each individual identifiable. they are not a mammal as whales are  but the largest fish in the ocean  laying eggs rather than birthing live young as whales do. the term shark comes from the shape of the fins and their bodies but technically they are closer to filter feeding whales at 40 feet long rather than carnivorous sharks.  --  music by christopher comstock https://www.reverbnation.com/chrisvcomstock [whale sharks the gypsie princess scuba divers snorkeling stargate swimming aquatic marine life gulf of mexico chris comstock]'

_label_poor 'brave rhino tries to withstand the elephant - wild animals fighting rhino meets elephants and tries to prove that he is the owner of the territory. what will be the outcome?  a rhinoceros  often abbreviated to rhino  is one of any five extant species of odd-toed ungulates in the family rhinocerotidae  as well as any of the numerous extinct species. two of these extant species are native to africa and three to southern asia. members of the rhinoceros family are characterized by their large size (they are some of the largest remaining megafauna  with all of the species able to reach one tonne or more in weight); as well as by an herbivorous diet; a thick protective skin  1.5–5 cm thick  formed from layers of collagen positioned in a lattice structure; relatively small brains for mammals this size (400–600 g); and a large horn. they generally eat leafy material  although their ability to ferment food in their hindgut allows them to subsist on more fibrous plant matter  if necessary. unlike other perissodactyls  the two african species of rhinoceros lack teeth at the front of their mouths  relying instead on their lips to pluck food. rhinoceros are killed by humans for their horns  which are bought and sold on the black market  and which are used by some cultures for ornamental or traditional medicinal purposes. east asia  specifically vietnam  is the largest market for rhino horns. by weight  rhino horns cost as much as gold on the black market. people grind up the horns and then consume them believing the dust has therapeutic properties. the horns are made of keratin  the same type of protein that makes up hair and fingernails. both african species and the sumatran rhinoceros have two horns  while the indian and javan rhinoceros have a single horn.  elephants are large mammals of the family elephantidae and the order proboscidea. two species are traditionally recognised  the african elephant and the asian elephant  although some evidence suggests that african bush elephants and african forest elephants are separate species. elephants are scattered throughout sub-saharan africa  south asia  and southeast asia. elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order proboscidea; other  now extinct  members of the order include deinotheres  gomphotheres  mammoths  and mastodons. male african elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7 000 kg (15 000 lb). all elephants have several distinctive features  the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis  used for many purposes  particularly breathing  lifting water  and grasping objects. their incisors grow into tusks  which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. elephants large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. african elephants have larger ears and concave backs while asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs. elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs  forests  deserts  and marshes. they prefer to stay near water. they are considered to be keystone species due to their impact on their environments. other animals tend to keep their distance from elephants while predators  such as lions  tigers  hyenas  and wild dogs  usually target only young elephants (or calves). females (cows) tend to live in family groups  which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. the groups are led by an individual known as the matriarch  often the oldest cow. elephants have a fission–fusion society in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. males (bulls) leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males. adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth  which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild.  all information according to www.wikipedia.org  bison vs grizzly bear vs moose vs elk vs deer vs buffalo vs wolf vs bull vs lion vs tiger vs elephant vs giraffe vs rhino vs gorilla vs whale vs shark vs panther vs python vs anaconda vs jaguar vs boar vs walrus vs polar bear vs hyena vs warthog vs hippo vs wolves vs wolfpack vs cobra vs mongoose vs alligator vs yak vs piranha. wild animals fighting.  please submit your original video to stonehengesubmit@gmail.com* * - we can only accept and publish material if you are the original owner of the video submitted.  if you see a clip that you own and you did not submit it or give consent for use  we have likely received false permission and would be happy to resolve this for you!

_label_poor '5 extinct animals captured in camera and seen in real life! 5 extinct animals captured on camera in real life description: extinction has been a controversial subject since it was suggested by scientists in the 19th century. in the time elapsed since then the tests have come to show that extinction might not be so permanent after all. with this said these are 5 extinct animals captured on camera and seen in real life. .... ready? ... begin...!!  1. dinosaur in africa while the rest of the animals have recently lived this animal lived millions of years ago. according to reports  a tribe in the republic of congo captured a velociraptor in the jungle that they proudly put on display. while the dinosaurs allegedly became extinct 65 million years ago some people believe that the small populations continued to survive in the deepest and darkest desert far from human contact. sometimes it is believed that these possible survivors are the origin of snake dragons and other great monsters of human mythology. it may be possible that something undiscovered and unexplained continue to prosper in the 500 million hectares of rainforest in the congo that inspired the story of joseph conrad heart of darkness.  2. the whale omura the omura whale is a species of whale recently discovered originally in the years 2000 by a japanese researcher. it was discovered through dna analysis found in the whale bones at the bottom of the ocean in the years 90. it was believed that the whale that had hitherto not been discovered was extinguished. it was later discovered that the bones belonged to a dwarf fin or pygmy whale that was rarely seen across asia.  3. mammoth wooly mammoth wooly is believed to have been hunted to extinction by man during the ice age. while their relatives survived to become a modern asian elephant mammoths are theorized to have been dead 10 000 years ago. some have theorized that the woolly mammoths continued to live and existed in cold regions where they were safe from humans and warmer temperatures. they believe that the preserved and mummified corpses of mammoths found in these areas could be evidence of this and sightings of mammoths have been reported in the wild. this video captures one of those sightings like a wooly mammoth allegedly tries to cross a frozen river in a forest in siberia.  4. tasmanian tiger the tasmanian tiger was a carnivorous marsupial that emigrateded australia before it died. it is also known as the tasmano wolf despite having no connection with wolves or tigers due to its dog and tiger appearance-with stripes. the tasmanian tigers were already rare before the british settlers arrived and believed to have died out on the island of australia even though the species continued to live on the island of tasmania from which it took its name. due to a combination of excessive hunting and habitat invasion this creature would have been extinguished in the 1990s when the last wild tasmanian tiger was killed in 1930. on the other hand. there have always been rumors about this subject.. and this video captures a tasmanian tiger in australia. go...  5. megalodon the myths about big fish as sea monsters are universal to human conditions. the best known may be the legend of the leviathan an ancient and giant fish or whale that ate the biblical figure job. although traditionally it was believed that the leviathan had been a whale the discovery of the ancient and supposedly extinct megalodon shark led people to believe that perhaps the inspiration for leviathan had originally been a giant shark. while it is believed that megalodonios are extinct only 5% of the ocean has been explored and day-to-day biologists discover new species of creatures and even rediscover species that previously were considered extinct. it is not impossible that an evolutionary return to the megalodon can continue to exist. this giant shark was captured by the japanese marine biologists in 2016 background music: kevin macleod-kevin macleod music of the end: for copyright subjects do not hesitate to send me an email here: officialamerikano@hotmail.com _____ ______ _____... __________... _______. __________ thank you very much for watching this video................. give like if you liked this video animals strange creatures real life captured in camera captured in video captured in camara extinct animals that could revive in real viral camera strange animals caught monsters megalodon strange animals extinct animals extinct animals live extinct creatures captured in camera captured in video captured extinct animals that could still live captured extinct animals found alive capture'

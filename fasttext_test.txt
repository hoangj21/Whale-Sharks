__label__poor Large wave drenches tourist trying to get video of whales The Galapagos Sky is a small cruise ship that takes 16 tourists on a remote and incredible adventure to the outermost reaches around the Galapagos Islands. Embarking on a dive adventure that would lead them to Wolf and Darwin Islands to meet hammerhead sharks and whale sharks, these tourists were watching the beautiful scenery and catching an occasional glimpse of pilot whales and fin whales. One brave Canadian tourist decided to wander up front, despite the waves, to try to capture a whale breach on video. What he caught instead was the slap of a large wave that came crashing over the bow. Quickly deciding that the lower deck wasnt the best place to be in rough seas, he made a hasty retreat. He couldnt help but laugh when he realized that the boat captain had been able to see the whole episode from the bridge, and he was laughing even harder. The two of them had a very different perspective on the same event. As an afterthought, he can be seen checking that the camera is still working to make sure the salt water hasnt wrecked it. Our Canadian friend also had some explaining to do when he went back inside the ship, dripping wet to join the other tourists. The Galapagos Sky is an amazing ship, with a crew that prides themselves on service that is beyond anybodys expectations. The one week tour took these adventurous scuba divers to one of the most remote, hostile, and beautiful places on the planet. Several BBC series have been produced that describe this magical and unforgiving world. As a dive destination, it is second to none. These guests saw unique birds, marine iguanas, several different species of sharks, and the most sought after creature of all, the magnificent whale shark. Their trip to this remote paradise was truly the adventure of a lifetime.nnSource & embed code: https://rumble.com/v75ht4-boat-wav-completely-drenches-tourist.html.nnFor licensing, please email licensing@rumble.com. viral videos,funny videos,funny and weird,entertainment life,large wave

It is a protruding pinnacle and drops to over 150ft. You have to watch your depth and keep an eye on your dive computers. We normally try to stay between 40 and 70 ft. Due to the currents and surges we see many schools of fish and a good chance for mantas and also whale sharks.nnwww.sirenasdivingcostarica.comnnMoseying around ... mirando a todos los peces y estamos buceando en Bajo Negro, Isla Murciu00E9lagos. Bajo Negro es nuestra tercera inmersiu00F3n cuando buceamos en Murciu00E9lagos. Es un pinu00E1culo sobresaliente y desciende a mu00E1s de 150 pies. Encontramos algunos bonitos tiburones de arrecife de punta blanca nadando debajo de nosotros. Tienes que ver tu profundidad y controlar tus computadoras de buceo. Normalmente intentamos permanecer entre 40 y 70 pies. Los tiburones tenu00EDan al menos 80 pies. El visibilidad fue realmente bueno y se podu00EDa ver todo el camino hasta el fondo. Debido a las corrientes y marejadas vemos muchas escuelas de peces y una buena oportunidad para las mantas y tambiu00E9n para los tiburones ballena. diving,scuba diving,diving costa rica,costa rica diving,buceo,black rock,bajo negro,bat islands,isla murcialgos,costa rica,adventure travel,sharks,tiburones

__label__good enormous whale shark descends through divers from above scuba divers from all around the world consider the galapagos islands to be one of their bucket list travel destinations. there are many reasons that they feel the allure of this world. it could be the hammerheads that congregate in enormous schools  the sea turtles in abundance  the harsh  yet beautiful landscape that has caused such unique adaptations in the animal life. for many  it is the chance to see whale sharks  the biggest shark in the ocean and one of the largest animals alive. the galapagos provide a very real possibility of encountering one or two. the three distinct ocean currents that converge here bring an abundance of food and create ideal conditions for whale sharks during certain months.  imagine the dream coming true for these divers as they are carried along on the current  exploring the waters around darwin island  one of the most iconic locations in the world. a large shadow appeared over their heads and they realized that not only were they seeing one of the majestic beasts above  but she was descending right toward them. she is a large  pregnant female  over fifty feet in length. possibly curious  possibly somehow aware of their admiration  she circles slowly as she dives  passing through their bubbles and among the group. some of the divers had ascended to 60 feet  as the dive was nearing its end. others remained at eighty feet. incredibly  this whale shark spiraled downward  giving them all a breathtaking view as she did so. from the cameramanu2019s point of view  the divers below were only partially visible but their bubbles show their position and the whale shark can be seen gracefully passing by them.  the divers below couldnu2019t resist and they sank slowly with her  prolonging the encounter as much as they could. for a scuba diver  such a meeting is unforgettable and extremely emotional.  source & embed code: https://rumble.com/v6vusm-whale-shark-descends-through-divers.html.  for licensing  please email licensing@rumble.com. viral videos cool videos amazing videos amazing animals wild wildlife ocean life unreal animals whale shark

__label__poor Whale Shark at  Sail Rock 07 July 2017 Underwater video Considered the premier dive site in the Gulf of Thailand, Sail Rock  is a pinnacle which rises to 15m above and 40m below the surface. Sail Rock lies between Koh Phangan and Koh tao. Its famous for its natural underwater vertical swim through or chimney which divers can enter at 6 metres and exit at 18. It is also the visiting site of many larger pelagic fish  including chevron barracuda, big schools of mackerel, jacks, trevally and tuna. You may encounter a seasonal whale shark with over 40 spotted at Sail Rock in 2013 alone.  Giant moray eels and lion fish have also taken up residency. The Trigger fish are also very playful during their nesting period!nnhttps://www.pond5.com/artist/Kovbannhttp://hinbhairesort.comnhttp://en.fotolia.com/p/203930711/partner/203930711 Sail,Rock,diving,underwater,video,fish,whale,u043Au0438u0442u043Eu0432u0430u044F,u0430u043Au0443u043Bu0430,uACE0uB798,uC0C1uC5B4,shark,u0E09u0E25u0E32u0E21u0E27u0E32u0E2C,PADI,course,IDC,center,star,BullShark,dive,barracuda,funny,grouper,angel,bigeye,maclel,queenfish,undersea,coral,jellyfish,u30B8u30F3u30D9u30A4u30B6u30E1,starfish,wether,report,aquatic,manta,ray,u043Fu043Eu0434u0432u043Eu0434u043Du043Eu0435,u0432u0438u0434u0435u043E

__label__good swimming with my whale shark family... sorry for the unclear 360 4k footage you need to move the screen around to see the whales...  -----  finally got to meet up with some aquatic family in the gulf of mexico this past trip..was wild.  as we headed out dolphins suddenly appeared by our boat swimming alongside us (you can one jumping at the very beginning).  we circled for an hour but the two whale sharks were feeding down below and werent surfacing until the very end. then we jumped in two by two!  these are enormous creatures  look at the size of us by them! on my way back to the boat my swim partner called out  look hes right under us and i dived back in.  sure enough he was basking with his massive mouth wide open and had come straight behind us following our trail back to the boat. my camera was literally in his mouth and i had to pull back so as to stay circling him. (of course i panicked and hit the record button again so that switched off the video and you cant see how close he came to me..duh  sorry about that).  the two sharks hung around really relaxed in our company; it was majestic.  ---  whale sharks have unique spots on their backs and bellies similar to human fingerprints making each individual identifiable. they are not a mammal as whales are  but the largest fish in the ocean  laying eggs rather than birthing live young as whales do. the term shark comes from the shape of the fins and their bodies but technically they are closer to filter feeding whales at 40 feet long rather than carnivorous sharks.  --  music by christopher comstock https://www.reverbnation.com/chrisvcomstock whale sharks the gypsie princess scuba divers snorkeling stargate swimming aquatic marine life gulf of mexico chris comstock

__label__good nature guide makes dream come true for scuba diver tour guests imagine meeting not one whale shark face to face  but twelve! these scuba divers have traveled from canada to the galapagos islands for the trip of a lifetime. they embarked on a 7 day voyage aboard the galapagos sky  a tour boat that would take them to one of the most remote  hostile  and challenging environments on the planet. it is also one of the most beautiful places on earth. they were hoping for a sighting of a whale shark  the most massive and majestic shark in the ocean. it is the biggest fish and also the biggest animal in the world  with the exception of a few species of whale. they are beautiful creatures and despite their intimidating size  they are harmless and gentle. for a scuba diver  there is no greater experience than to swim with a whale shark. these divers were about to experience something beyond their wildest dreams. the tourists were under the guidance of christian rueda  a very experienced and talented nature guide and scuba diver. they are seasoned adventurers  but they needed specific training about how to dive in the strong currents in the galapagos. it took christian several days of intense instruction to increase their skills to the point that they were ready for these dives. entering the water in rough waves and strong current is not for the faint of heart. after investing so much in this trip  christian understandably felt a lot of pressure to provide them with the view of a whale shark they were hoping for. as they braved the waters around darwin island  christian was faced with the biggest challenge. actually finding these whale sharks is often a nearly impossible task. studying the conditions carefully  he chose the time and the spot and led the divers to a rock ledge under darwins arch  70 feet below the surface. incredibly  one of the massive creatures appeared on the second day. christian had the divers lined up on the wall to watch and wait. surrounded by hammerhead sharks  sea turtles and fish  it was like watching the most massive and spectacular imax screen. when the whale shark slowly cruised past on the ocean current  the divers followed their guide out into the blue to meet it face to face. what they saw and felt when they came close enough to touch this majestic animal cannot be described. for the next five days  christian found his guests whale sharks 11 more times. their experience in the waters of the galapagos islands left them in awe. this video provides us with a few highlights from their adventure. few people have ever met one of these creatures close up and even fewer have met 12 in one week.  source & embed code: https://rumble.com/v71dre-scuba-divers-have-dream-encounter-with-whale-sharks-in-galapagos-islands.html.  for licensing  please email licensing@rumble.com. viral videos cool videos amazing videos amazing animals wild wildlife ocean life unreal animals whale shark

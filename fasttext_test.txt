__label__poor Large wave drenches tourist trying to get video of whales The Galapagos Sky is a small cruise ship that takes 16 tourists on a remote and incredible adventure to the outermost reaches around the Galapagos Islands .  Embarking on a dive adventure that would lead them to Wolf and Darwin Islands to meet hammerhead sharks and whale sharks ,  these tourists were watching the beautiful scenery and catching an occasional glimpse of pilot whales and fin whales .  One brave Canadian tourist decided to wander up front ,  despite the waves ,  to try to capture a whale breach on video .  What he caught instead was the slap of a large wave that came crashing over the bow .  Quickly deciding that the lower deck wasnt the best place to be in rough seas ,  he made a hasty retreat .  He couldnt help but laugh when he realized that the boat captain had been able to see the whole episode from the bridge ,  and he was laughing even harder .  The two of them had a very different perspective on the same event .  As an afterthought ,  he can be seen checking that the camera is still working to make sure the salt water hasnt wrecked it .  Our Canadian friend also had some explaining to do when he went back inside the ship ,  dripping wet to join the other tourists .  The Galapagos Sky is an amazing ship ,  with a crew that prides themselves on service that is beyond anybodys expectations .  The one week tour took these adventurous scuba divers to one of the most remote ,  hostile ,  and beautiful places on the planet .  Several BBC series have been produced that describe this magical and unforgiving world .  As a dive destination ,  it is second to none .  These guests saw unique birds ,  marine iguanas ,  several different species of sharks ,  and the most sought after creature of all ,  the magnificent whale shark .  Their trip to this remote paradise was truly the adventure of a lifetime . nnSource & embed code: https: /  / rumble . com / v75ht4-boat-wav-completely-drenches-tourist . html . nnFor licensing ,  please email licensing@rumble . com .

__label__good scuba diver scrambles to avoid whale sharks approaching tail divers in the galapagos islands had the incredible experience of meeting a massive whale shark up close .  the giant beast is almost 50 feet long and could weigh as much as 100 000 pounds .  they are the biggest fish in the ocean and  aside from some whale species  the largest animal in the world .  divers wait a lifetime to catch a glimpse of these majestic creatures and some dare to dream of capturing a picture or video of them .  for almost all scuba divers  this is the ultimate underwater experience .  despite their enormous size  they are the gentlest souls in the ocean and will never harm a human .  most encounters are brief  as whale sharks dont often seek interaction with people .  they will veer away  or even dive deep if they are concerned .  a few sweeps of their massive tail will carry them quickly to safety .  but this particular whale shark seemed mildly curious about the divers .  she is a large female  carrying young that will be born soon .  she approached a group of divers and swam slowly through the middle of them  giving them an arms length encounter that none of them will ever forget .  as if wanting to get her own look at them  she arced gracefully  curving past several and allowing some a second look .  kristy couldnt resist the once in a lifetime opportunity and began snapping photographs as the whale shark circled below her .  drifting in the strong current  kristy found herself directly over the sharks back only a few feet from it .  respectful divers will not touch marine life  especially a whale shark  and they try to avoid accidental contact .  knowing the massive tail was approaching her  kristy scurried over the sharks back and tucked her fins in to avoid being struck by the tail .  equally concerned about the danger of impact and the possibility of upsetting the whale shark  she made sure that she was out of the way .  being in the presence of such a huge and majestic creature leaves a lasting impression that will never be forgotten .   source & embed code: https: /  / rumble . com / v6riow-scuba-diver-has-to-hop-over-whale-shark-to-avoid-approaching-tail . html .   for licensing  please email licensing@rumble . com .

__label__poor BIGGEST FISHES IN THE WORLD | WHALE SHARKS VIDEO | DRONE VIDEO BIGGEST FISHES IN THE WORLD | WHALE SHARKS | DRONE VIDEOnThe whale shark  ( Rhincodon typus )  is a slow-moving filter-feeding carpet shark and the largest known extant fish species .  The largest confirmed individual had a length of 12 . 65 m  ( 41 . 5 ft )  and a weight of about 21 . 5 t  ( 47 , 000 lb )  .  Unconfirmed claims of considerably larger individuals ,  over 14 m  ( 46 ft )  long and weighing at least 30 t  ( 66 , 000 lb )  ,  are not uncommon . [citation needed] The whale shark holds many records for sheer size in the animal kingdom ,  most notably being by far the largest living nonmammalian vertebrate .  It is the sole member of the genus Rhincodon and the only extant member of the family Rhincodontidae  ( called Rhiniodon and Rhinodontidae before 1984 )  ,  which belongs to the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes .  The species originated about 60 million years ago . nnThe whale shark is found in open waters of the tropical oceans and is rarely found in water below 22 u00B0C  ( 72 u00B0F )  .  Modeling suggests a lifespan of about 70 years ,  but measurements have proven difficult .  Whale sharks have very large mouths and are filter feeders ,  which is a feeding mode that occurs in only two other sharks ,  the megamouth shark and the basking shark .  They feed almost exclusively on plankton and are not known to pose a threat to humans . nnThe species was distinguished in April 1828 after the harpooning of a 4 . 6 m  ( 15 ft )  specimen in Table Bay ,  South Africa .  Andrew Smith ,  a military doctor associated with British troops stationed in Cape Town ,  described it the following year .  The name whale shark directly refers to the fishs size ,  being as large as some species of whales and also that it is a filternna whale shark attack , na whale shark video , nwhale shark , nwhale shark and diver , nwhale shark aquarium , nwhale shark attack , nwhale shark biggest , nwhale shark cancun , nwhale shark cebu , nwhale shark cutting alive , nwhale shark diver , nwhale shark diving , nwhale shark documentary , nwhale shark drone , nwhale shark eating , nwhale shark facts , nwhale shark feeding , nwhale shark fishing , nwhale shark gopro , nwhale shark in oslob cebu , nwhale shark in the philippines , nwhale shark swimming , nwhale shark videos ,  [a whale shark attack , a whale shark video , whale shark , whale shark and diver , whale shark aquarium , whale shark attack , whale shark biggest , whale shark cancun , whale shark cebu , whale shark diver , whale shark diving , whale shark documentary , whale shark drone , whale shark eating , whale shark facts , whale shark feeding , whale shark fishing , whale shark gopro , whale shark swimming , whale shark videos

He had seen these majestic creaturesu2014the worldu2019s largest fishu2014swim alongside his ship during the week-long journey in the Indian Ocean . nnDecades after ,  when a middle-aged Pandey drove along the Gujarat coastline asking people about the u201Cbig fishu201D ,  which did not have a local name ,  no one knew what he was talking about .  Then ,  in 1996 ,  a builder of fibreglass boats in Bhavnagar described the beautifully patterned fish accurately and said that in some villages ,  people hunted it on occasion .  Locals did not eat the fish ,  but they used oil from the liver to waterproof wooden boats . nnPerhaps the boat-builder was unaware of more recent developments: From 1991 onwards ,  whale sharks had been killed in large numbers in Gujarat ,  fuelled by the demand for their fins and meat in South-east Asia and Europe . nnIn any case ,  after the chat with the builder ,  the quest began in earnest .  In 1998 ,  Pandey sighted his first whale shark in the murky waters of the Veraval harbour .  As large as a trawler ,  it lay cut open .  Two men who had clambered on were hacking at its insides .  As life ebbed out of the hapless fish ,  Pandey remembers making a silent pledge: he would save the gentle giants of the Gujarat coast . nnPandeyu2019s crew went about filming the hunting of the whale shark .  In 2000 ,  the resulting documentary u201CShores of Silenceu201D won the Wildscreen Panda Award ,  the equivalent of the Oscar for natural history films  ( watch it here )  One year later ,  after intense lobbying ,  the Indian government banned the killing of whale sharks . nnThat was not all .  In 2002 ,  at a gathering of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora  ( CITES )  ,  even as the conference was winding down ,  the panel agreed to a re-vote on whale sharks .  After watching Pandeyu2019s documentary ,  an overwhelming majority voted to put the fish on a list of species not in immediate danger of extinction ,  but in need of trade restrictions in order to ensure their survival . nnIn India ,  the whale shark was already on a par with the charismatic tiger ,  as far as legal protection goes .  But three years into the ban ,  a survey along the Gujarat coast showed that even in Veraval ,  the hub of the whale shark fisheries ,  few knew of its status . nnA u201CSave the Whale Sharksu201D movement was launched in Gujarat in 2004 ,  to change attitudes towards the fish that visits its shores from September to May .  The campaign was a joint venture of the Wildlife Trust of India-International Fund for Animal Welfare  ( WTI-IFAW )  ,  Tata Chemicals Ltd and the Gujarat forest department . nnWhale shark ,  the largest known fish species .  Photo: Venkat CharloonMorari Bapu ,  a spiritual leader revered by many in Gujarat ,  became a campaign ambassador .  At the launch ,  he spoke about the tradition of non-violence and the idea of honouring guests .  Warming to the theme ,  he equated the visits of whale shark to a beloved daughter coming home to give birth to her child . nnThis metaphor became the theme for a street play which featured a fisherman ,  a potential hunter of whale sharks ,  whose pregnant daughter comes home to deliver her baby .  The plot linked the fate of the fish and that of the daughter ,  so ultimately the fisherman resolves to save and protect both . nnWith the play becoming a hit in the fishing villages ,  the fish known as u201Cbarrelu201D became vhali ,  meaning u201Cdear oneu201D ,  which was the name of the daughter in the play .  A 4oft inflatable whale shark ,  which served as the backdrop ,  drew in the crowds .  Inland ,  too ,  kids loved the life-sized model of vhali .  They touched it and wanted to know more about the fish . nnPorbandar ,  the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi ,  was [asiatic , lion , lioness , cubs , leopard , python , cat , dog , dear , wildlife , animal , attack , sasan , gir , girnar , flora-fauna , forest , national , park , sanctuary , mating , safari , junagadh , junagarh , gujarat , india , rescue , jambur , siddi , tribes , african , license , stock , footage , licensing , Jungle , floods , rain , biodiversity , narendra , modi , great , rare , amezing , unique , u0936u0947u0930 , u090Fu0936u093Fu092Fu093Eu0908 , u092Cu092Cu094Du092Cu0930 , u0936u0947u0930u0928u0940 , u0938u0902u092Du094Bu0917 , u0936u093Eu0935u0915 , u0924u0947u0902u0926u0941u0906 , u091Cu0902u0917u0932 , u0938u093Eu0938u0928 , u0917u093Fu0930 , u0917u0941u091Cu0930u093Eu0924 , u0928u0930u0947u0928u094Du0926u094Du0930 , u092Eu094Bu0926u0940 , u0905u0926u092Du0941u0924 , u0926u0941u0930u094Du0932u092D , u0905u092Du0942u0924u092Au0942u0930u094Du0935 , u0905u0926u094Du0935u093Fu0924u0940u092F , u092Bu093Eu0930u0947u0938u094Du091F , u0935u0928u0938u094Du092Au0924u093F , u091Cu0940u0935 , u091Cu0942u0928u093Eu0917u095D , u092Du093Eu0930u0924

In place of pranks we love toys learning friendship together ,  and theres sure to be plenty of fun surprises as well .  So join our finger family for nursery rhymes learning and fun games with color changing Finding Dory toys ! nninding Dory is a 2016 American 3D computer-animated comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures . nnDory ,  a regal blue tang ,  gets separated from her parents as a child .  As she grows up ,  Dory attempts to search for them ,  but gradually forgets them due to her short-term memory loss disability .  In the flashback of the previous film ,  Finding Nemo ,  after accidentally running into Marlin ,  a clownfish who is looking for his missing son ,  Nemo ,  she joins him on his journey . nnOne year later ,  Dory has joined Marlin and Nemo on their reef .  One day ,  Dory has a flashback and remembers that she has parents .  She decides to look for them ,  but finds her memory problem an obstacle .  She remembers that they lived at the Jewel of Morro Bay across the ocean in California . nnMarlin and Nemo accompany Dory .  With the help of Crush ,  a sea turtle friend ,  they ride a water current to California .  Upon arrival ,  Dory accidentally awakens a squid ,  who immediately pursues them ,  almost devouring Nemo .  Marlin berates Dory for endangering them .  Her feelings hurt ,  Dory travels to the surface to seek help and is captured by staff members from the nearby Marine Life Institute after getting entangled in six pack rings . nnDory is placed in the quarantine section and tagged .  There she meets a grouchy but well-meaning octopus named Hank .  Dorys tag shows that she will be sent to an aquarium in Cleveland .  Due to a traumatic ocean life ,  Hank wants to live in the aquarium instead of being released back into the ocean ,  so he agrees to help Dory find her parents in exchange for her tag .  In one exhibit ,  Dory encounters her childhood friend Destiny ,  a nearsighted whale shark who used to communicate with Dory through pipes ,  and Bailey ,  a beluga whale who mistakenly believes he has lost his ability to echolocate .  Dory subsequently has flashbacks of life with her parents and struggles to recall details .  She finally remembers how she was separated from her parents: she overheard her mother crying one night ,  left to retrieve a shell to cheer her up ,  and was pulled away by an undertow current . nnMarlin and Nemo attempt to rescue Dory .  With the help of two sea lions named Fluke and Rudder and a disfigured common loon named Becky ,  they manage to get into the institute and find her in the pipe system .  Other blue tangs tell them that Dorys parents escaped from the institute a long time ago to search for her and never came back ,  leaving Dory believing that they have died .  Hank retrieves Dory from the tank ,  accidentally leaving Marlin and Nemo behind .  He is then apprehended by one of the employees and unintentionally drops Dory into the drain ,  flushing her out to the ocean .  While wandering aimlessly ,  she comes across a trail of shells; remembering that when she was young ,  her parents had set out a similar trail to help her find her way back home ,  she follows it .  At the end of the trail ,  Dory finds an empty home with multiple shell trails leading to it .  As she turns to leave ,  she sees her parents Jenny and Charlie in the distance .  They tell her they spent years laying down the trails for her to follow in the hopes that she would eventually find them . nnMarlin ,  Nemo ,  and Hank end up in the truck taking various aquatic creatures to Cleveland .  Destiny and Bailey escape from their exhibit to help Dory rescue them .  Once on board the truck ,  Dory persuades Hank to return to the sea with her ,  and together ,  they hijack the truck and drive it over busy highways ,  creating havoc ,  before crashing it into the ocean ,  freeing all the fish .  Dory ,  along with her parents and new friends ,  return to the reef with Marlin and Nemo . nnHeres how to say Disney Finding Dory in other languages: u062Fu064Au0632u0646u064A u0627u0644u0639u062Bu0648u0631 u0639u0644u0649 u062Fu0648u0631u064A ,  u8FEAu58EBu5C3Cu627Eu5230dory ,  Disney paghahanap dory ,  Disney recherche dory ,  Disney findet dory ,  u30C7u30A3u30BAu30CBu30FCu3092u898Bu3064u3051u308Bu30C9u30EAu30FC ,  uB514uC988uB2C8 uCC3EuAE30 uB3C4uB9AC ,  Disney encontrando dory ,  u0414u0438u0441u043Du0435u0439 u0441u0447u0438u0442u0430u0435u0442 ,  u0447u0442u043E ,  [Toon Tube , Yippee toys , Baby Big Mouth , TheEngineeringFamily , learning video , juego , brinquedos , surpresas , full episodes , full movie , cartoon , toy review , finger family , nursery rhymes , finding dory toys , finding dory color change , learn your colors , learn colors , finding dory surprise eggs , dory colors , dory color change , finding nemo color change , dory coloring

__label__poor Breaking News  - Scientists have taken ultrasounds from wild whale sharks Share this article   Share  Its the biggest shark in the sea ,  often found roaming in warm waters around the globe with its huge mouth agape in search of dinner . u00A0Yet despite its hulking appearance ,  the whale shark is actually incredible docile and only has tiny ,  almost useless teeth  Pictured is an ultrasound   No one knows how many whale sharks are left but rough estimates put their numbers somewhere in the tens of thousands worldwide .  Pictured is an ultrasoundu00A0   Its thanks to its docile nature that scientists have been able to complete ultrasounds and take blood samples from these sharks in the Galapagos   The incredible results allowed them to see and identify reproductive organs ,  such as the ovaries ,  and even developing follicles   Researchers led by conservationists from the Galapagos Whale Shark Project looked at whale sharks near Darwin Island ,  in the far north of the Galapagos Archipelago   This remote volcanic island is one of the few places where huge adult female whale sharks ,  which are up to 14 m  ( 45 ft )  in length ,  are commonly seen each year  While they are comparable in size to whales ,  whale sharks are sharks   They typically grow to be bigger than a double-decker bus: between 6 to 16 meters  ( 20 to 52 feet )  and more than 20 tons   The gentle giants arent particularly fast when compared to other sharks ,  but a simple wave of their tail propels them through the water faster than any human could ever swim   Almost nothing is known about the reproduction of these giant sharks ,  said Jonathan R .  Green ,  the expedition leader and founder of the Galapagos Whale Shark Project   After I first saw these huge female whale sharks in the far north Galapagos ,  I realised that this was a great opportunity to learn more ,  said Dr Green   Weve been able to put together an experienced team to research sharks in this remote area ,  one of the worlds most isolated dive sites ,  Dr Green said   All tags are transmitting well ,  so we should get great information on where these sharks swim over the months to come ,  said Professor Hearn   Kiyomi Murakumo from Okinawa Churashima Foundation ,  successfully collected blood samples from six adult sharks   Sex steroid hormone levels in the blood are an excellent way to monitor reproduction in individual sharks ,  Dr Murakumo said   This study measured levels of estradiol ,  progesterone and testosterone of wild ,  adult female whale sharks for the first time in the world   Whale sharksu00A0feed by scooping huge amounts of tiny plankton and small fish from the water - particularly near the surface and in warm water   They typically grow to be bigger than a double-decker bus: between 6 to 16 meters  ( 20 to 52 feet )  and more than 20 tons   As filter feeders ,  the enormous whale sharks are dangerous only to the plankton ,  fish eggs and tiny fish they chomp onnAutoNews- Source:https: /  / www . dailymail . co . uk / sciencetech / article-6319721 / Scientists-taken-ultrasounds-wild-whale-sharks-Galapagos . html ? ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490 [Scientists , taken , ultrasounds , wild , whale , sharks , Galapagos , AutoNews , breaking news , hot news , sciencetech

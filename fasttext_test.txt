It is eighteen metres long .  It eats small fish and plants in the sea .  It lives in warm waters and drivers sometimes see one on the sea near Kuwait .  They are not dangerous but they are very big so you mustnu2019t swim near them . n ( b )  A puffer fish has got four very sharp teeth .  Some puffer fish have got spikes .  When it is frightened ,  a puffer fish drinks a lot of water so it is round and bigger . n ( c )  Turtles have got beautiful shells .  When they want to lay eggs ,  they walk very slowly up the beach ,  dig a hole in the sand and lay their eggs in it . n ( d )  Butterfly fish have got beautiful colours and patterns .  They live in the coral reef .  The other fish canu2019t see them because butterfly can hide in the colourful reefs u2013 then they canu2019t eat them !

After that ,  we ate Cebu lechon WHICH IS THE BEST FOR ME HOMAYGAHD .  It was a simple day for Day 1 because the next day was when we head for Oslob to see the whale sharks .

__label__good sharks protect sharks marine policy suggest that around 100 million sharks are killed every year by humans .  this number might be vast beyond comprehension but the journal also recognises that it is a conservative estimate and it could by closer to 273 million killed each year .  taking the 100 million estimate  it works out at 11 416 sharks killed across the globe every single hour .   ( metro . co . uk )   shark killing has to end because  .  .  . as apex predators  sharks play an important role in the ecosystem by maintaining the species below them in the food chain and serving as an indicator for ocean health .  they help remove the weak and the sick as well as keeping the balance with competitors helping to ensure species diversity .  by taking sharks out of the coral reef ecosystem  the larger predatory fish  such as groupers  increase in abundance and feed on the herbivores .  with less herbivores  macroalgae expands and coral can no longer compete  shifting the ecosystem to one of algae dominance  affecting the survival of the reef system .

__label__poor 7 Unanswered Questions About Sharks 7 Unanswered Questions About Sharks:wildlife discovery . nnwildlife videos:https: /  / youtu . be / QuCfGfTkl-snn7 Unanswered Questions About SharksnnShark mysteriesnAsk any shark biologist a question about sharks ,  and chances are ,  the answer will begin with ,  Were not really sure ,  butu2026nThats because researchers know remarkably little about these deep-ocean creatures .  There are more than 400 species of shark ,  and many of them fare poorly in captivity ,  making it difficult to observe their mating ,  navigational ,  learning and social  ( or anti-social )  behavior . nIn celebration of the Discovery Channels Shark Week ,  here are seven mysteries that scientists have yet to solve about sharks . nn1 )  How do sharks navigate ? nThe open ocean has few visual cues ,  so how do sharks know where theyre going ?  Some sharks travel great distances ,  such as the great white sharks that swim across the Indian Ocean ,  from the west coast of Australia to South Africa ,  said Andrew Nosal ,  a postdoctoral researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the Birch Aquarium . nIt is an enduring mystery how sharks find their way through the ocean ,  which environmental cues they use ,  and how exactly those cues are detected and integrated ,  Nosal told Live Science . nThere is compelling evidence that some sharks use geomagnetic navigation ,  meaning that they can sense Earths magnetic field ,  orient to it and use it as a navigational tool ,  he said .  Olfaction  ( smell )  may be another navigational tool that some sharks use .  But perhaps other factors u2014 such as water temperature ,  sound and even vision  ( to some extent )  u2014 may help sharks navigate the deep ,  Nosal said . nn2 )  How many species exist ? nResearchers are still discovering new species of shark ,  especially from the deep ocean . nThese habitats are so mysterious because they are so removed from human activity ,  Nosal said .  We still dont know what lives there . nFor instance ,  the so-called ninja shark  ( Etmopterus benchleyi )  was announced to the scientific world in December 2015; a newfound species of hammerhead shark  ( Sphyrna gilberti )  off the coast of South Carolina was identified in 2013; and a new species of walking shark  ( Hemiscyllium halmahera )  ,  shown here ,  made headlines after researchers discovered it in a reef off an Indonesian island ,  according to a 2013 study in the Journal of Ichthyology . nMoreover ,  sharks can range greatly in size ,  from as small as a cigar to as large as a school bus  ( such as the whale shark ,  a plankton feeder )  .  They also live in diverse habitats ,  so a newfound species could be uncovered anywhere ,  Nosal said . nn3 )  Why do sharks migrate ? nIts clear that many sharks migrate seasonally ,  different trackers show .  But why these fish migrate is still a mystery . nWeve got great technology that tells us where they are going ,  said Gregory Skomal ,  a fisheries biologist with the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries .  But we dont know what drives the migration . nDo sharks migrate for food ,  mating ,  temperature or perhaps a mixture of all three ?  Its hard to say ,  even after studying a handful of sharks within the same species ,  Nosal said . nI might track 10 leopard sharks ,  and they all do something thats a little bit different ,  Nosal said .  Its hard to pull out the patterns to explain whats going on . nOnly by studying vast numbers of a single species of shark can researchers find overall trends and perhaps tease out the reasons behind each migration ,  he said .  .  . nnAccording to Live Science . nnThank you for watching ! nnDont forget to like this video ,  and subscribe for the next video . nn#researchsciences [Unanswered , Questions , Sharks , science daily , science articles , interesting science articles , 21 news , news information knowledge , news documentary , endtime news update today , end times news , breaking news today , 21 news channel and friends , 21 new channel , community news , today , news , knowledge , science

__label__poor The hawksbill sea turtle at Sail Rock 05 September 2018 Underwater video Considered the premier dive site in the Gulf of Thailand ,  Sail Rock  is a pinnacle which rises to 15m above and 40m below the surface .  Sail Rock lies between Koh Phangan and Koh tao .  Its famous for its natural underwater vertical swim through or chimney which divers can enter at 6 metres and exit at 18 .

__label__good the biggest fish in the sea  the whaleshark  ( rhincodon typus )   koh tao  thailand .  the whale shark  ( rhincodon typus )  is a slow-moving  filter-feeding carpet shark and the largest known extant fish species .  the largest confirmed individual had a length of 12 . 65 m  ( 41 . 5 ft )  and a weight of about 21 . 5 t  ( 47 000 lb )  .  the whale shark holds many records for size in the animal kingdom  most notably being by far the largest living nonmammalian vertebrate .  it is the sole member of the genus rhincodon and the only extant member of the family rhincodontidae which belongs to the subclass elasmobranchii in the class chondrichthyes .  before 1984 it was classified as rhiniodon into rhinodontidae .   the whale shark is found in open waters of the tropical oceans and is rarely found in water below 21 u00B0c  ( 70 u00B0f )  . [2] modeling suggests a lifespan of about 70 years  but measurements have proven difficult . [9] whale sharks have very large mouths and are filter feeders  which is a feeding mode that occurs in only two other sharks  the megamouth shark and the basking shark .  they feed almost exclusively on plankton and small fishes  and pose no threat to humans .   cjeck out my facebook & instaggram for more photos & videos .  https: /  / www . facebook . com / videoandphotowtc /  https: /  / www . instagram . com / wtc . productions /  [whalehark rhincodon typus koh tao scuba diving koh tao diving koh tao diving schools diving school scuba diving certification scuba diving course diving lessons scuba shop diving certification diving in thailand padi courses dive shop koh tao ko tao koh tao thailand scuba diving scuba what is scuba diving best diving in thailand diving big blue diving koh thai padi koh phangan big blue bigblue thailand koh tao

Youu2019d be amazed every time you caught something ,  and your parents would act impressed ,  too ,  even if it was smaller than your palm .  At the time youu2019d find it hard to believe that there were creatures in the ocean bigger than that .  Obviously ,  now that youu2019ve grown older ,  youu2019re aware of some of the huge beasts that grace our seas .  Of course ,  thereu2019s the blue whale or the great white shark ,  but have you ever considered some of the lesser-known creatures out there ? nnWeu2019ve put together a list of some of the biggest living things youu2019ll find in the ocean u2013 although theyu2019re not necessarily all things you would like to catch .  For example ,  you most definitely do not want to come across a Giant Spider Crab while paddling at the shore ,  although chance would be a fine thing ,  as they donu2019t tend to swim to the surface .  Or what about the Fin Whale ?  A far friendlier giant ,  itu2019s one you should try and see in your lifetime u2013 if it doesnu2019t get hunted into extinction anytime soon . nnIf youu2019re venturing further afield ,  and happen to be in Antarctica ,  you might be lucky enough to be greeted by a Southern Elephant Seal .

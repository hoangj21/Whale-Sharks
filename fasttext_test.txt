__label__poor Todays Wanders: Cebu 2018 Day 1 | Alex Simeon The Cebu 2018 trip last October 28-31 was the first time that I kinda traveled without the usual people in my videos being my Mom and Neo .  Really grateful that my mom allowed me to join Uncle Jay ,  Tita Ruby ,  and Ate Saris trip .  It is also my first time in Cebu .  For Day 1 ,  we were stuck in the airport due to delayed flight then once we arrived at Cebu ,  we checked in at our hotel then went to the mall to roam around .  After that ,  we ate Cebu lechon WHICH IS THE BEST FOR ME HOMAYGAHD .  It was a simple day for Day 1 because the next day was when we head for Oslob to see the whale sharks .

__label__poor BIGGEST FISHES IN THE WORLD | WHALE SHARKS VIDEO | DRONE VIDEO BIGGEST FISHES IN THE WORLD | WHALE SHARKS | DRONE VIDEOnThe whale shark  ( Rhincodon typus )  is a slow-moving filter-feeding carpet shark and the largest known extant fish species .  The largest confirmed individual had a length of 12 . 65 m  ( 41 . 5 ft )  and a weight of about 21 . 5 t  ( 47 , 000 lb )  .  Unconfirmed claims of considerably larger individuals ,  over 14 m  ( 46 ft )  long and weighing at least 30 t  ( 66 , 000 lb )  ,  are not uncommon . [citation needed] The whale shark holds many records for sheer size in the animal kingdom ,  most notably being by far the largest living nonmammalian vertebrate .  It is the sole member of the genus Rhincodon and the only extant member of the family Rhincodontidae  ( called Rhiniodon and Rhinodontidae before 1984 )  ,  which belongs to the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes .  The species originated about 60 million years ago . nnThe whale shark is found in open waters of the tropical oceans and is rarely found in water below 22 u00B0C  ( 72 u00B0F )  .  Modeling suggests a lifespan of about 70 years ,  but measurements have proven difficult .  Whale sharks have very large mouths and are filter feeders ,  which is a feeding mode that occurs in only two other sharks ,  the megamouth shark and the basking shark .  They feed almost exclusively on plankton and are not known to pose a threat to humans . nnThe species was distinguished in April 1828 after the harpooning of a 4 . 6 m  ( 15 ft )  specimen in Table Bay ,  South Africa .  Andrew Smith ,  a military doctor associated with British troops stationed in Cape Town ,  described it the following year .  The name whale shark directly refers to the fishs size ,  being as large as some species of whales and also that it is a filternna whale shark attack , na whale shark video , nwhale shark , nwhale shark and diver , nwhale shark aquarium , nwhale shark attack , nwhale shark biggest , nwhale shark cancun , nwhale shark cebu , nwhale shark cutting alive , nwhale shark diver , nwhale shark diving , nwhale shark documentary , nwhale shark drone , nwhale shark eating , nwhale shark facts , nwhale shark feeding , nwhale shark fishing , nwhale shark gopro , nwhale shark in oslob cebu , nwhale shark in the philippines , nwhale shark swimming , nwhale shark videos ,  [a whale shark attack , a whale shark video , whale shark , whale shark and diver , whale shark aquarium , whale shark attack , whale shark biggest , whale shark cancun , whale shark cebu , whale shark diver , whale shark diving , whale shark documentary , whale shark drone , whale shark eating , whale shark facts , whale shark feeding , whale shark fishing , whale shark gopro , whale shark swimming , whale shark videos

__label__poor Scuba diving Tofo ,  Mozambique Praia do Tofo is a small town in southeastern Mozambique known for its long sandy beaches ,  great surf ,  and healthy coral reefs .  The regular presence of whale sharks ,  manta rays and migrating humpback whales makes it Mozambiques diving hotspot ,  with divers visiting from all over the world . nnI did two dives at the popular shallow reef Mikes Cupboard - at mostly 12 - 15m you can easily spend an hour exploring this rocky outcrop pockmarked with craters and potholes supporting an abundance of snappers ,  angelfish ,  pipefish ,  boxies and huge shoals of fusiliers . nnThe reef is also home to octopus ,  morays ,  various ray species ,  and camouflaged scorpion fish . nnOn the first dive I used the GoPro Hero 7 in its hypersmooth mode ,  which made for much less jerky footage - helpful when the swell is pushing you back and forward above the reef . nnThe second dive was done with my older GoPro Hero 4 ,  which is still up to the task - if not quite as smooth as the 7 . nnBoth dives were done through Liquid Dive Adventures - a top notch scuba diving centre and PADI IDC [

The wreck has been completely colonised by coral during the 50 years that it has spent in the Tulamben waters .  During almost 20 years ,  it was simply stranded on the beach and rusted ,  the paint freeing itself bit by bit from the steel plates .  The marine paint having been made to avoid the formation of life ,  coral and algae ,  many wrecks where the paint has remained relatively intact in the world have not been able to be colonised by as much coral ,  which makes the Liberty wreck unique .  We can find multicoloured gorgonias of a couple of meters at a depth of 12 and 14 meters ,  on the front section of the ship .  Life is everywhere on the wreck !  You will see humphead parrot fish ,  schools of trevally ,  Leaf scorpion fish ,  pygmee sea horses ,  giant barracuda ,  frog fish ,  groupers ,  jack fish ,  angel fish ,  black tip and white tip sharks .  If you are very lucky you may even encounter a whale shark ,  an eagle ray or even a Mola ! nnnThanks for the music tracks to:nBoards -  Francis PrevenNew Land - ALBISnSt .

__label__good enormous whale shark descends through divers from above scuba divers from all around the world consider the galapagos islands to be one of their bucket list travel destinations .  there are many reasons that they feel the allure of this world .  it could be the hammerheads that congregate in enormous schools  the sea turtles in abundance  the harsh  yet beautiful landscape that has caused such unique adaptations in the animal life .  for many  it is the chance to see whale sharks  the biggest shark in the ocean and one of the largest animals alive .  the galapagos provide a very real possibility of encountering one or two .  the three distinct ocean currents that converge here bring an abundance of food and create ideal conditions for whale sharks during certain months .   imagine the dream coming true for these divers as they are carried along on the current  exploring the waters around darwin island  one of the most iconic locations in the world .  a large shadow appeared over their heads and they realized that not only were they seeing one of the majestic beasts above  but she was descending right toward them .  she is a large  pregnant female  over fifty feet in length .  possibly curious  possibly somehow aware of their admiration  she circles slowly as she dives  passing through their bubbles and among the group .  some of the divers had ascended to 60 feet  as the dive was nearing its end .  others remained at eighty feet .  incredibly  this whale shark spiraled downward  giving them all a breathtaking view as she did so .  from the cameramanu2019s point of view  the divers below were only partially visible but their bubbles show their position and the whale shark can be seen gracefully passing by them .   the divers below couldnu2019t resist and they sank slowly with her  prolonging the encounter as much as they could .  for a scuba diver  such a meeting is unforgettable and extremely emotional .   source & embed code: https: /  / rumble . com / v6vusm-whale-shark-descends-through-divers . html .   for licensing  please email licensing@rumble . com .

It is so incredible how these big creatures fly in the water .  You can book a manta ray snorkeling tour anywhere .  Yet you should know that the snorkeling is at the coast Nusa Penida ,  an island very close to Bali .  Actually many instagram photos are from here ! nWhen you see the film ,  you will notice all the stuff floating in the water .  It is not all trash ,  but still way too much .

__label__poor 7 Unanswered Questions About Sharks 7 Unanswered Questions About Sharks:wildlife discovery . nnwildlife videos:https: /  / youtu . be / QuCfGfTkl-snn7 Unanswered Questions About SharksnnShark mysteriesnAsk any shark biologist a question about sharks ,  and chances are ,  the answer will begin with ,  Were not really sure ,  butu2026nThats because researchers know remarkably little about these deep-ocean creatures .  There are more than 400 species of shark ,  and many of them fare poorly in captivity ,  making it difficult to observe their mating ,  navigational ,  learning and social  ( or anti-social )  behavior . nIn celebration of the Discovery Channels Shark Week ,  here are seven mysteries that scientists have yet to solve about sharks . nn1 )  How do sharks navigate ? nThe open ocean has few visual cues ,  so how do sharks know where theyre going ?  Some sharks travel great distances ,  such as the great white sharks that swim across the Indian Ocean ,  from the west coast of Australia to South Africa ,  said Andrew Nosal ,  a postdoctoral researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the Birch Aquarium . nIt is an enduring mystery how sharks find their way through the ocean ,  which environmental cues they use ,  and how exactly those cues are detected and integrated ,  Nosal told Live Science . nThere is compelling evidence that some sharks use geomagnetic navigation ,  meaning that they can sense Earths magnetic field ,  orient to it and use it as a navigational tool ,  he said .  Olfaction  ( smell )  may be another navigational tool that some sharks use .  But perhaps other factors u2014 such as water temperature ,  sound and even vision  ( to some extent )  u2014 may help sharks navigate the deep ,  Nosal said . nn2 )  How many species exist ? nResearchers are still discovering new species of shark ,  especially from the deep ocean . nThese habitats are so mysterious because they are so removed from human activity ,  Nosal said .  We still dont know what lives there . nFor instance ,  the so-called ninja shark  ( Etmopterus benchleyi )  was announced to the scientific world in December 2015; a newfound species of hammerhead shark  ( Sphyrna gilberti )  off the coast of South Carolina was identified in 2013; and a new species of walking shark  ( Hemiscyllium halmahera )  ,  shown here ,  made headlines after researchers discovered it in a reef off an Indonesian island ,  according to a 2013 study in the Journal of Ichthyology . nMoreover ,  sharks can range greatly in size ,  from as small as a cigar to as large as a school bus  ( such as the whale shark ,  a plankton feeder )  .  They also live in diverse habitats ,  so a newfound species could be uncovered anywhere ,  Nosal said . nn3 )  Why do sharks migrate ? nIts clear that many sharks migrate seasonally ,  different trackers show .  But why these fish migrate is still a mystery . nWeve got great technology that tells us where they are going ,  said Gregory Skomal ,  a fisheries biologist with the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries .  But we dont know what drives the migration . nDo sharks migrate for food ,  mating ,  temperature or perhaps a mixture of all three ?  Its hard to say ,  even after studying a handful of sharks within the same species ,  Nosal said . nI might track 10 leopard sharks ,  and they all do something thats a little bit different ,  Nosal said .  Its hard to pull out the patterns to explain whats going on . nOnly by studying vast numbers of a single species of shark can researchers find overall trends and perhaps tease out the reasons behind each migration ,  he said .  .  . nnAccording to Live Science . nnThank you for watching ! nnDont forget to like this video ,  and subscribe for the next video . nn#researchsciences [Unanswered , Questions , Sharks , science daily , science articles , interesting science articles , 21 news , news information knowledge , news documentary , endtime news update today , end times news , breaking news today , 21 news channel and friends , 21 new channel , community news , today , news , knowledge , science

__label__good nature guide makes dream come true for scuba diver tour guests imagine meeting not one whale shark face to face  but twelve !  these scuba divers have traveled from canada to the galapagos islands for the trip of a lifetime .  they embarked on a 7 day voyage aboard the galapagos sky  a tour boat that would take them to one of the most remote  hostile  and challenging environments on the planet .  it is also one of the most beautiful places on earth .  they were hoping for a sighting of a whale shark  the most massive and majestic shark in the ocean .  it is the biggest fish and also the biggest animal in the world  with the exception of a few species of whale .  they are beautiful creatures and despite their intimidating size  they are harmless and gentle .  for a scuba diver  there is no greater experience than to swim with a whale shark .  these divers were about to experience something beyond their wildest dreams .  the tourists were under the guidance of christian rueda  a very experienced and talented nature guide and scuba diver .  they are seasoned adventurers  but they needed specific training about how to dive in the strong currents in the galapagos .  it took christian several days of intense instruction to increase their skills to the point that they were ready for these dives .  entering the water in rough waves and strong current is not for the faint of heart .  after investing so much in this trip  christian understandably felt a lot of pressure to provide them with the view of a whale shark they were hoping for .  as they braved the waters around darwin island  christian was faced with the biggest challenge .  actually finding these whale sharks is often a nearly impossible task .  studying the conditions carefully  he chose the time and the spot and led the divers to a rock ledge under darwins arch  70 feet below the surface .  incredibly  one of the massive creatures appeared on the second day .  christian had the divers lined up on the wall to watch and wait .  surrounded by hammerhead sharks  sea turtles and fish  it was like watching the most massive and spectacular imax screen .  when the whale shark slowly cruised past on the ocean current  the divers followed their guide out into the blue to meet it face to face .  what they saw and felt when they came close enough to touch this majestic animal cannot be described .  for the next five days  christian found his guests whale sharks 11 more times .  their experience in the waters of the galapagos islands left them in awe .  this video provides us with a few highlights from their adventure .  few people have ever met one of these creatures close up and even fewer have met 12 in one week .   source & embed code: https: /  / rumble . com / v71dre-scuba-divers-have-dream-encounter-with-whale-sharks-in-galapagos-islands . html .   for licensing  please email licensing@rumble . com .

__label__poor Whale Shark Passes Nearby ,  Oslob ,  Cebu Island ,  Philippines Short clip of a whale shark swimming through a dive group in Oslob ,  Philippines . nnThere is a wee bit of controversy surrounding the sharks in this area ,  as they are fed by locals in order to attract them to boats for tourists .  The food apparently isnt sufficient for the whale sharks needs ,  and the constant supply of food stops them from migrating properly .  I went along with a dive group to see the process in action ,  and I cannot recommend going on one of these tourist boats if you care about the welfare of these creatures . nnPlease also be careful of which dive company you chose to go with ,  some genuinely care about the sharks and will use the larger proportion of your dive fee to help with the conservation of sharks .  Other dive companies are less concerned with the sharks wellbeing .  [Whale Shark , diving , oslob , philippines , scuba , cebu island , shark

__label__poor Discover Scuba Diving Thailand - Programme 4 - Koh Samui ,  Koh Tao ,  Chumphon Enjoy a broad overview on diving locations ,  facilities ,  accommodations ,  and further activities for your perfect diving vacation to Thailand on the new multi-lingual DVD .  See ,  where you can meet whale sharks ,  manta rays ,  turtles ,  ghost pipe fishes ,  or dive into wrecks . nWe examined the most beautiful dive spots for you  ( see the Thailand Map for an overview )  and took all videos at the original locations ourselves: There is no old stuff .  shapeimage_1_link_0nIn addition ,  we visited lots of facilities and met instructors and divers ,  evaluated accommodations ,  and found other activities interesting for your holidays ,  that we truly can recommend - we awarded them the Dive Club Thailand Seal . nBesides the videos from the original locations  ( in English ,  German ,  Russian ,  Japanese ,  Finnish ,  and Swedish )  ,  all this information is included in the supplemental Information Booklet  ( in English )  with all the addresses for your direct contact . nOn this Website ,  you get an overview of the four programmes the DVD contains  ( South Thailand ,  East Thailand ,  Andaman Sea ,  and Gulf of Thailand )  .  As you will see ,  it is made by enthusiastic divers for both experienced divers and those who just want to learn it . nAdditionally ,  we offer the contacts and addresses for those who know all these beautiful diving locations in Thailand and enjoyed snorkelling ,  scuba diving ,  technical diving  ,  and the enormous variety of marine life in Thailand already . nnThe final programme on the DVD takes you to the beautiful islands in the southern Gulf of Thailand .  Koh Tao ,  Koh Samui and Koh Phangan have been visited by tourists for many years and never fail to satisfy  .  .  .  with powder white sandy beaches and turquoise blue waters . nEach island has something different to offer  .  .  .  Koh Tao is more laid back without much development it is the backpackers dream .  Koh Samui and Koh Phangan have received a little more investment and developed over recent times but it is still possible to find your own secluded beach . nWe show you each of the islands and the dive sites which can be found around each .  Chumphon is around 520 km south of Bangkok but only 2 hours by boat from Koh Tao and is the eco tourists dream . nVery little development has been made here and the forests and rivers inland are flowing with flora and fauna .  Chumphon has a number of local islands which have very little diving over the years yet ,  which offer the diver the opportunity to see several marine critters like Sea Horses ,  Frog Fish and Cleaner Shrimps . nAs shown in the DVD we think Chumphon and the Islands make excellent destinations for those people who want to learn to dive ,  with its combination of good visibility and shallower dive sites its the perfect place to gain your confidence .

Youu2019d be amazed every time you caught something ,  and your parents would act impressed ,  too ,  even if it was smaller than your palm .  At the time youu2019d find it hard to believe that there were creatures in the ocean bigger than that .  Obviously ,  now that youu2019ve grown older ,  youu2019re aware of some of the huge beasts that grace our seas .  Of course ,  thereu2019s the blue whale or the great white shark ,  but have you ever considered some of the lesser-known creatures out there ? nnWeu2019ve put together a list of some of the biggest living things youu2019ll find in the ocean u2013 although theyu2019re not necessarily all things you would like to catch .  For example ,  you most definitely do not want to come across a Giant Spider Crab while paddling at the shore ,  although chance would be a fine thing ,  as they donu2019t tend to swim to the surface .  Or what about the Fin Whale ?  A far friendlier giant ,  itu2019s one you should try and see in your lifetime u2013 if it doesnu2019t get hunted into extinction anytime soon . nnIf youu2019re venturing further afield ,  and happen to be in Antarctica ,  you might be lucky enough to be greeted by a Southern Elephant Seal .  Youu2019ll be surprised to find out why itu2019s named that ,  too .  Some other interesting beasts in our video include the Lionu2019s Mane Jellyfish ,  the Oceanic Manta Ray and the Whale Shark ,  but youu2019ll have to watch the video to find out the rest .

Our trip was organized by the guesthouse \"Koimala Hotel\". The boat in which we went in search of a whale shark also belongs to this guesthouse. The boat is run by the employees of this hotel. On this day we were lucky with the weather. The sun was shining brightly, a gentle wind was blowing and the Indian Ocean was calm. Our trip lasted about 3 hours. We three times jumped into the water to look at the Whale Shark, but Ira and I only once (and not for very long) saw the blurred shadow of the Whale Shark at depth. In the second part of the video hit the moment when in the bottom of the place gathered boats and boats. If you look around, you can count them up to a dozen.\nChannel #TaksaTravels \"In Search of a Whale Shark\".\n--------\nREST MALDIVA 2018 INDEPENDENTLY https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLalvdWvkzTWArcV818FSxv_gaZRuRU-wC\n\nPOWER SUPPLY (FOOD) MALDIVA 2018 INDEPENDENTLY https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLalvdWvkzTWATh5jQvngYqzER2iOrgtxp\n\nMALDIVES 2018 REST FOR TWO https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLalvdWvkzTWBrFMTUYzjSOBBVKZLni0qk\n\nMAAFUSHI ISLAND 2018 MALDIVES INDEPENDENTLY https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLalvdWvkzTWDBkm_UUrUlXicEpouBMfDd\n\nISLAND HULHUMALE 2018 MALDIVES INDEPENDENTLY https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLalvdWvkzTWB2I763Z_xbNN4IjtXZZitf\n\nISLAND MAMIGILEY 2018 MALDIVES INDEPENDENTLY https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLalvdWvkzTWCC60VJNBIDUSlVHHBl1Faz\n\nISLAND GURAYDO 2018 MALDIVES INDEPENDENTLY https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLalvdWvkzTWCX_1BMbpYETuap2oaeCEnk\n\nISLAND OF THE DISTRIBUTION 2018 MALDIVES INDEPENDENTLY https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLalvdWvkzTWDCEFDR32JVEE-3znk-uSx7\n\nMALE CITY 2018 MALDIVES INDEPENDENTLY https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLalvdWvkzTWCXdLcCBElE9qeaLJ9Fx-Qw\n\nMALDIVES 2018 HEART ON EARTH https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLalvdWvkzTWAoch8vugsEpvQARpEVmNzw\n\nOur channel: TaksaTravels - Dmitry and Irina https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCB8aK4tCxZnj9SMyG1Lj4Tg [\"\u043C\u0430\u043B\u044C\u0434\u0438\u0432\u044B\",\"Maldives\",\"\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043E 360 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0443\u0441\u043E\u0432\",\"video 360 degrees\"

They are not dangerous but they are very big so you mustn\u2019t swim near them.\n(b) A puffer fish has got four very sharp teeth. Some puffer fish have got spikes. When it is frightened, a puffer fish drinks a lot of water so it is round and bigger.\n(c) Turtles have got beautiful shells.

'divers swim through hammerheads to meet huge whale shark whale sharks are the largest known fish in the ocean. with the exception of some whale species  they are the largest animals on earth. although we know very little about them  we do know that they can reach a length of 55 feet or more and can live to over 70 years of age. the weight of a full grown whale shark is estimated to be approximately 50 000 pounds. roughly the size of a school bus  they dwarf even the largest great white sharks. they are gentle and slow moving giants that feed on plankton  krill  small fish  fish eggs and crab larvae. although they have enormous mouths  they are filter feeders and incapable of posing a threat to humans or any other large animals. they follow ocean currents to feed  populating all tropical seas. with one of the most distinctive skin patterns in the animal kingdom  they are easily recognizable. their spots are as unique as the fingerprints of humans. no two whale sharks are exactly alike. scuba divers consider whale shark sightings to be one of the most sought after experiences. for most  it is the ultimate thrill  and swimming alongside one for more than a moment is likely to be one of life\u2019s most memorable events. these divers have traveled to darwin island  the most famous of the galapagos islands  hopeful to see a whale shark. the galapagos are one of the most diverse and remarkable areas on our planet. the environment is hostile and beautiful at the same time  and because three great currents converge around them  the habitat produces a food supply that attracts hammerhead sharks  galapagos sharks  sea turtles  dolphins  and more pregnant female whale sharks than most other areas of the world. researchers don\u2019t know where they go to have their young but they do know that almost 100 per cent of whale sharks sighted here are mothers carrying babies. scuba divers make a rapid descent to the rocky bottom  eager to find shelter from the powerful currents that could sweep them away. they perch themselves on rocky ledges and peer out into the vast blue  waiting for that moment when one of these beautiful beasts will appear in front of them. the ledge around darwin\u2019s arch is aptly named \u201Cthe theatre\u201D and the show is a live performance that rivals any imax experience. the divers watch as schools of fish and large hammerhead sharks cruise past  along with occasional turtles and a few other shark species. the appearance of a whale shark is uncertain and often they are only seen from a distance. the dive guide will keep one eye on the group and the other on the depths beyond. if he sees a whale shark  he will signal the group by rattling a small shaker and he will point in the direction that they need to go. they quickly add air to their buoyancy vests and head into the blue to meet the shark and get a closer look. this large female whale shark is approximately 50 feet long and is carrying young. with a slow approach  divers were able to swim alongside her at a depth of about 60 feet. she calmly swept her tail back and forth  effortlessly maintaining a pace that a diver must work hard to match. if she becomes concerned  a few powerful sweeps of her massive tail will propel her out of reach in seconds. she is also capable of descending quickly to retreat from a threat. whale sharks are often accepting  even curious  when they encounter scuba divers. a close encounter such as this one is something that very few divers will ever experience and it was a dive that these lucky people will never forget. the guides and crew of the galapagos sky and float \u2018n\u2019 flag dive shop provided this group with exceptional memories that will be cherished forever.

'Large wave drenches tourist trying to get video of whales The Galapagos Sky is a small cruise ship that takes 16 tourists on a remote and incredible adventure to the outermost reaches around the Galapagos Islands. Embarking on a dive adventure that would lead them to Wolf and Darwin Islands to meet hammerhead sharks and whale sharks, these tourists were watching the beautiful scenery and catching an occasional glimpse of pilot whales and fin whales. One brave Canadian tourist decided to wander up front, despite the waves, to try to capture a whale breach on video. What he caught instead was the slap of a large wave that came crashing over the bow. Quickly deciding that the lower deck wasn\'t the best place to be in rough seas, he made a hasty retreat. He couldn\'t help but laugh when he realized that the boat captain had been able to see the whole episode from the bridge, and he was laughing even harder. The two of them had a very different perspective on the same event. As an afterthought, he can be seen checking that the camera is still working to make sure the salt water hasn\'t wrecked it. Our Canadian friend also had some explaining to do when he went back inside the ship, dripping wet to join the other tourists. The Galapagos Sky is an amazing ship, with a crew that prides themselves on service that is beyond anybody\'s expectations. The one week tour took these adventurous scuba divers to one of the most remote, hostile, and beautiful places on the planet. Several BBC series have been produced that describe this magical and unforgiving world. As a dive destination, it is second to none. These guests saw unique birds, marine iguanas, several different species of sharks, and the most sought after creature of all, the magnificent whale shark. Their trip to this remote paradise was truly the adventure of a lifetime.\n\nSource & embed code: https:\/\/rumble.com\/v75ht4-boat-wav-completely-drenches-tourist.html.\n\nFor licensing, please email licensing@rumble.com.

'Diving Thailand Sail Rock 11 June 2017  Underwater video Considered the premier dive site in the Gulf of Thailand, Sail Rock  is a pinnacle which rises to 15m above and 40m below the surface. Sail Rock lies between Koh Phangan and Koh tao. It\'s famous for its natural underwater vertical swim through or chimney which divers can enter at 6 metres and exit at 18. It is also the visiting site of many larger pelagic fish  including chevron barracuda, big schools of mackerel, jacks, trevally and tuna. You may encounter a seasonal whale shark with over 40 spotted at Sail Rock in 2013 alone.  Giant moray eels and lion fish have also taken up residency.

'top 5 dinosaur fights and prehistory  which really happened. top 5 dinosaur fights and prehistory  which really happened.\\nsummary: the dinosaurs are considered as titanic monsters who once trod the earth. but just as in nature  the atmosphere of prehistory  it was a war zone. where fighting and struggling to survive  was the daily bread. from clashes between carnivorous and herbivorous dinosaurs  to fights in the sea  by territory. on this occasion  we will review those dinosaur fights and other great rivalries of prehistory that really happened.\\n\\n\\nnumber 5: spinosaurus vs carcharodontosaurus.\\nin the 2008  a spinosaurus vertebra was found fractured. no one knew that animal would be able to inflict such damage on him. later on  the bbc paleontologists said that this fracture was caused by a carchadontosaurus. these two dinosaurs usually would not have met  but when the drought affected the environment in which they lived  these carnivores faced more than once  fighting for food.\\n\\nnumber 4: titanoboa vs carbonemis.\\n\\ncolombia  60 million years ago. this was the scene of a fight of superpredators. on the one hand  we have the biggest snake known... the titanoboa. this snake  on many occasions was disputed its territory with a tortoise that was just as giant... the carbonemys turtle. paleontologists from the university of north carolina claim that this tortoise had a bite so potent that allowed him to defend himself from predators  and even confront them if necessary. although there is no evidence that the titanoboa and this tortoise have clashed. what we do know is that both fossils were found in the same area.\\n\\nnumber 3: t-rex vs triceratops.\\n\\nthe tyrannosaurus rex is known for being one of the most ruthless predators in the cretaceous. it is known that he fed on any living being that crossed his path.\\nhowever  there is a prey  which was not so easy to hunt. and it is nothing more and nothing less than the triceratops.\\ntyrannosauruss bite marks on the fossils of triceratops indicate that these two dinosaurs were always struggling for their survival. many times this struggle has been portrayed in popular culture  both in films and in exhibitions. having the tyrannosaurus some victories and some defeats.\\nwithout a doubt  these two dinosaurs converted the cretaceous period into a battlefield for survival.\\n\\nnumber 2: bear of the caverns vs. american lion.\\n\\nthe confrontation between the lion of the caverns and the bear of the caverns. the lion of the caverns  named thus  because several of his bones were found in the caverns. although it is doubtful that these lions have lived there. hence  there is a hypothesis that these lions  could have ventured into these caverns  in search of bears for their augmentation. but because the cave bear  was a giant that reached a height of 1.3 meters  many scientists think that the lion attacked them when they were still hibernating.\\n\\nnumber 1: gigantosaurus vs argentinosaurus.\\n\\nthere is evidence  that these true titans of prehistory have clashed. on the one hand  the argentinosaurus  a dinosaur with an approximate size of 33 meters in length  and the other  the gigantosaurus  a carnivorous 13 meters long. it has been speculated that the gigantosaurus  on many occasions hunted these great animals. but to do so  the gigantosaurus resorted to the group attacks  causing real struggles for survival.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nground zero: megalodon vs livyathan melvillei.\\n\\nthe competition for food in the miocene sea. the miocene  was the time when there were two giant predators. on one hand the megalodon and the other the lyviathan melivillei  a prehistoric killer whale. these two predators always vied for food in the miocene sea.\\nit has been said that his constant struggle for food caused one of them to move from his place of home  and then possibly become extinct.\\ntoday  killer whales are known to kill large sharks. would it be that this was also the prehistory?\\nthinking about dinosaur fights and prehistoric struggles is a fascinating topic. we cant know if it really happened. but what we do know is that prehistory was not a paradise.\\n\\npowered by: http:\/\/swordlord3d.deviantart.com material used in this video: music and effects here: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2meqfmw animations and videos here: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2oakqsz you never know what you can find here  so follow me: facebook: bit.ly\/2aj1v6p [\\dinosaur fights\\  \\rex dinosaur fights\\  \\prehistoric animal fights\\  \\spinosaurus\\  \\t-rex\\  \\carnivores dinosaurs\\  \\spinosaurus vs carcharodontosaurus\\  \\t-rex vs triceratops\\  \\giganotosaurus\\  \\megalodon\\  \\livyathan\\  \\ livyathan melvillei vs megalodon \\ \\ bear of the caverns \\ \\ lion of the caverns \\ \\ cave bear vs. american lion \\ \\ dinosaurs \\ \\ prehistory \\ \\ documentaries \\ \\ top 5 \\ \\ minidocumentales \\ \\ topman \\ \\ documentaries in spanish \\ \\ dinosaur videos \\

'feature: whale sharks imagine having to swim with an actual whale shark here in kenya. well  marine experts in diani  kwale county have set aside over 1.2 billion shillings for the construction of a 300 meters ocean enclosure that would see the habitation of two of 60 whale sharks that are predominant in the area. the enclosure will provide an opportunity for tourists to swim with the magnificent creatures that grow up to about 13 meters long and weigh almost 12.5 tones as well as the construction of a whale shark research centre. as juney karisa reports the investment could realize an estimated 300 million shillings earnings annually to the tourism sector if adequately harnessed.

'Today\'s Wanders: Cebu 2018 Day 1 | Alex Simeon The Cebu 2018 trip last October 28-31 was the first time that I kinda traveled without the usual people in my videos being my Mom and Neo. Really grateful that my mom allowed me to join Uncle Jay, Tita Ruby, and Ate Sari\'s trip. It is also my first time in Cebu. For Day 1, we were stuck in the airport due to delayed flight then once we arrived at Cebu, we checked in at our hotel then went to the mall to roam around. After that, we ate Cebu lechon WHICH IS THE BEST FOR ME HOMAYGAHD. It was a simple day for Day 1 because the next day was when we head for Oslob to see the whale sharks. Here are videos from Day 1 of our trip.

'scuba diver scrambles to avoid whale sharks approaching tail divers in the galapagos islands had the incredible experience of meeting a massive whale shark up close. the giant beast is almost 50 feet long and could weigh as much as 100 000 pounds. they are the biggest fish in the ocean and  aside from some whale species  the largest animal in the world. divers wait a lifetime to catch a glimpse of these majestic creatures and some dare to dream of capturing a picture or video of them. for almost all scuba divers  this is the ultimate underwater experience. despite their enormous size  they are the gentlest souls in the ocean and will never harm a human. most encounters are brief  as whale sharks dont often seek interaction with people. they will veer away  or even dive deep if they are concerned. a few sweeps of their massive tail will carry them quickly to safety. but this particular whale shark seemed mildly curious about the divers. she is a large female  carrying young that will be born soon. she approached a group of divers and swam slowly through the middle of them  giving them an arms length encounter that none of them will ever forget. as if wanting to get her own look at them  she arced gracefully  curving past several and allowing some a second look. kristy couldnt resist the once in a lifetime opportunity and began snapping photographs as the whale shark circled below her. drifting in the strong current  kristy found herself directly over the sharks back only a few feet from it. respectful divers will not touch marine life  especially a whale shark  and they try to avoid accidental contact. knowing the massive tail was approaching her  kristy scurried over the sharks back and tucked her fins in to avoid being struck by the tail. equally concerned about the danger of impact and the possibility of upsetting the whale shark  she made sure that she was out of the way. being in the presence of such a huge and majestic creature leaves a lasting impression that will never be forgotten.  source & embed code: https:\/\/rumble.com\/v6riow-scuba-diver-has-to-hop-over-whale-shark-to-avoid-approaching-tail.html.  for licensing  please email licensing@rumble.com.

'BIGGEST FISHES IN THE WORLD | WHALE SHARKS VIDEO | DRONE VIDEO BIGGEST FISHES IN THE WORLD | WHALE SHARKS | DRONE VIDEO\nThe whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is a slow-moving filter-feeding carpet shark and the largest known extant fish species. The largest confirmed individual had a length of 12.65 m (41.5 ft) and a weight of about 21.5 t (47,000 lb). Unconfirmed claims of considerably larger individuals, over 14 m (46 ft) long and weighing at least 30 t (66,000 lb), are not uncommon.[citation needed] The whale shark holds many records for sheer size in the animal kingdom, most notably being by far the largest living nonmammalian vertebrate. It is the sole member of the genus Rhincodon and the only extant member of the family Rhincodontidae (called Rhiniodon and Rhinodontidae before 1984), which belongs to the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes. The species originated about 60 million years ago.\n\nThe whale shark is found in open waters of the tropical oceans and is rarely found in water below 22 \u00B0C (72 \u00B0F). Modeling suggests a lifespan of about 70 years, but measurements have proven difficult. Whale sharks have very large mouths and are filter feeders, which is a feeding mode that occurs in only two other sharks, the megamouth shark and the basking shark. They feed almost exclusively on plankton and are not known to pose a threat to humans.\n\nThe species was distinguished in April 1828 after the harpooning of a 4.6 m (15 ft) specimen in Table Bay, South Africa. Andrew Smith, a military doctor associated with British troops stationed in Cape Town, described it the following year. The name \"whale shark\" directly refers to the fish\'s size, being as large as some species of whales and also that it is a filter\n\na whale shark attack,\na whale shark video,\nwhale shark,\nwhale shark and diver,\nwhale shark aquarium,\nwhale shark attack,\nwhale shark biggest,\nwhale shark cancun,\nwhale shark cebu,\nwhale shark cutting alive,\nwhale shark diver,\nwhale shark diving,\nwhale shark documentary,\nwhale shark drone,\nwhale shark eating,\nwhale shark facts,\nwhale shark feeding,\nwhale shark fishing,\nwhale shark gopro,\nwhale shark in oslob cebu,\nwhale shark in the philippines,\nwhale shark swimming,\nwhale shark videos, [\"a whale shark attack\",\"a whale shark video\",\"whale shark\",\"whale shark and diver\",\"whale shark aquarium\",\"whale shark attack\",\"whale shark biggest\",\"whale shark cancun\",\"whale shark cebu\",\"whale shark diver\",\"whale shark diving\",\"whale shark documentary\",\"whale shark drone\",\"whale shark eating\",\"whale shark facts\",\"whale shark feeding\",\"whale shark fishing\",\"whale shark gopro\",\"whale shark swimming\",\"whale shark videos\"

'Diving Thailand Sail Rock 12 June 2017 Underwater video Considered the premier dive site in the Gulf of Thailand, Sail Rock  is a pinnacle which rises to 15m above and 40m below the surface. Sail Rock lies between Koh Phangan and Koh tao. It\'s famous for its natural underwater vertical swim through or chimney which divers can enter at 6 metres and exit at 18.

'There\'s a Shark Down There Moseying around...looking at all the fish and we are scuba diving around Black Rock, Bat Islands. Black Rock is our third dive when diving at Bat Islands. It is a protruding pinnacle and drops to over 150ft. You have to watch your depth and keep an eye on your dive computers. We normally try to stay between 40 and 70 ft. Due to the currents and surges we see many schools of fish and a good chance for mantas and also whale sharks.\n\nwww.sirenasdivingcostarica.com\n\nMoseying around ... mirando a todos los peces y estamos buceando en Bajo Negro, Isla Murci\u00E9lagos. Bajo Negro es nuestra tercera inmersi\u00F3n cuando buceamos en Murci\u00E9lagos. Es un pin\u00E1culo sobresaliente y desciende a m\u00E1s de 150 pies. Encontramos algunos bonitos tiburones de arrecife de punta blanca nadando debajo de nosotros. Tienes que ver tu profundidad y controlar tus computadoras de buceo. Normalmente intentamos permanecer entre 40 y 70 pies. Los tiburones ten\u00EDan al menos 80 pies. El visibilidad fue realmente bueno y se pod\u00EDa ver todo el camino hasta el fondo. Debido a las corrientes y marejadas vemos muchas escuelas de peces y una buena oportunidad para las mantas y tambi\u00E9n para los tiburones ballena.

The male whale shark measuring about five meters in length with a head of about 1.15 meters in width was determined dead upon examination, with injuries to its tailfin and other parts of its body the likely cause.

'Scuba diving Tofo, Mozambique Praia do Tofo is a small town in southeastern Mozambique known for its long sandy beaches, great surf, and healthy coral reefs. The regular presence of whale sharks, manta rays and migrating humpback whales makes it Mozambique\'s diving hotspot, with divers visiting from all over the world.\n\nI did two dives at the popular shallow reef Mike\'s Cupboard - at mostly 12 - 15m you can easily spend an hour exploring this rocky outcrop pockmarked with craters and potholes supporting an abundance of snappers, angelfish, pipefish, boxies and huge shoals of fusiliers.\n\nThe reef is also home to octopus, morays, various ray species, and camouflaged scorpion fish.\n\nOn the first dive I used the GoPro Hero 7 in its hypersmooth mode, which made for much less jerky footage - helpful when the swell is pushing you back and forward above the reef.\n\nThe second dive was done with my older GoPro Hero 4, which is still up to the task - if not quite as smooth as the 7.\n\nBoth dives were done through Liquid Dive Adventures - a top notch scuba diving centre and PADI IDC [

'Whale experts call for rethink of global shipping routes to stop marine giants becoming \u2018roadkill\u2019 In a new report, researchers from Macquarie University are calling for a rethink of global shipping routes, to protect whales and sharks from becoming marine \u2018roadkill\u2019.More than 10 billion metric tons of goods travel by sea each year, making up 80 per cent of the world\u2019s merchandise trade.The continual growth of the shipping trade and rebounding of some whale populations post-whaling is leading to increasing clashes between cargo ships and marine giants.Melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through previously untouched whale habitats.Marine megafauna like Great Whales, whale sharks and basking sharks are particularly vulnerable to ships because of their size, migration routes and the whales\u2019 need to travel close to the surface for air.Deadly ship strikes are not the only threat to the animals, with vessel noise disrupting whales\u2019 delicate communication, and chemical pollution and heavily used routes fragmenting habitats.Whale researcher Vanessa Pirotta from Macquarie University\u2019s Department of Biological Sciences said lessons from the wildlife impacts of roads could be applied to the ocean, to prevent marine giants becoming \u2018roadkill\u2019.\u201CNew shipping routes through whale habitat put vulnerable species at risk, and this study provides a new understanding of how to mitigate shipping traffic impacts on these marine giants,\u201D Ms Pirotta said.The report\u2019s authors propose limiting the creation of new shipping routes in areas such as the Arctic and broadening shipping exclusion zones to take into account the impact of ships beyond the marine roads themselves, such as noise pollution and chemical contamination.Designing cleaner and quieter ships would reduce the risk of oil spills and chemical pollution and reduce underwater noise.In addition, implementing speed limits and detours around whale habitats at certain times of year would mitigate some of the negative consequences.Ms Pirotta said: \u201CNew technologies can accurately monitor whale populations and behaviour, and if combined with data about shipping routes and intensity, could provide a clearer picture of their interaction.\u201CLooking at the impacts of roads on wildlife populations can then help predict what might happen if the shipping industry continues to expand, and this can inform better management plans to protect our marine giants.\u201DPirotta, V.,Grech, A.,Jonsen, I.,Laurance, W.and Harcourt, R.Consequences of global shipping traffic for marine giants.Front Ecol Environ.December 2018.doi.org\/10.1002\/fee.1987.

'Sharks Processing Factory In China A horrific look behind the scenes of the dietary supplement and bogus traditional Chinese medicine industry in Puqi, Zhejiang Province, China. Workers are seen chopping up the sharks and manta rays in unsanitary conditions that resemble a real charnel house. Many types of sharks are slaughtered in their thousands annually, then boiled up to remove the cartilage then ground to a powder for glucosamine sulphate and chondroitin joint repair dietary supplements. These \"health products\" are used by millions of people across the globe daily for bad elbows and knees. The filthy carnage seen on the floor of this factory would have been exported and sold in Europe, America and Asia. Manta ray gill rakers are used as a newly concocted bogus traditional Chinese medicine. WildLifeRisk is calling on the Chinese government to enact tougher wildlife protection legislation, and is pushing for greater enforcement of existing laws. WildLifeRisk is also calling on the public worldwide to refrain from consuming supposed health products such as Omega 3 \"fish\" oil (actually derived from whale shark liver oil, or \'squalene\') and \'glucosamine sulphate\' or \'chondroitin\' joint repair dietary supplements which both contain shark-related products.

It is famous for its stretches of white powdery sand beaches and its crystal clear blue waters that stretch along both sides of this island. Calanggaman Island has a length of only 753m and is uninhabitated.\n\nThe island gained more and more attention after 2013 when a big cruise ship stopped there to let its guest relax under the palm trees for a few hours.\n\nThere\u2019s no resort on Calanggaman Island but to provide some comfort for its visitors the local government built some basic facilities and assures safety by tourist policemen which are stationed on the island.\n\nIt is a perfect getaway for a just a day or a couple of days of camping. The snorkeling as well as the diving is beautiful and enjoyable in the calm waters around Calanggaman Island. Therefore Sea Explorers Dive Center in Malapascua as well as other diveshops are regularly offering diving and snorkeling trips to Calanggaman. Occasionally overnight stays in tents or hammocks are also being offered.\n\nSince there\u2019s no water or restaurants on the island be sure you bring your own supplies. You might have the possibility to buy some fresh fish caught by local fisherman which can be barbequed in one of the several grilling stations on the island.\n\nScuba divers can look forward to beautiful wall diving with abundance of soft and hard corals as well as well as a big variety of fish. Whale shark and also thresher shark encounters have been made here.\n\nthanks for watching\n\nfor more videos subscribe ,like comment and share [\"kalanggaman island\",\"most beautiful island in the world\",\"most beautiful island in the philippines\",\"most beautiful island in the world 2017\",\"the most beautiful island\",\"sandbar island\",\"vlog\",\"philippines\",\"island hopping cebu\",\"foreigner drinking with filipino\",\"island love\",\"island in the stream\",\"island in the sun\",\"island city\",\"island country\",\"kalanggaman island 4k\",\"kalanggaman island at night\",\"kalanggaman island in the philippines is my idea of paradise \u1F60D\uDE0D',poor

In general, hymns in the central text of the Sikhs, the Guru Granth Sahib, are called Gurbani. Among Amrit dhari Sikhs, a few texts from Dasam Granth which are read as Nitnem, like Tav-Prasad Savaiye and Chaupai, are also considered Gurbani. In Adi Granth, Gurbani is a sound which comes directly from the Supreme and the text is a written form of the same in worldly language and scripts. It is also called Gun Bani.[1] Gurbani are explanations of qualities of the Primal Lord and Soul which a Sikh should comprehend and with which he can attain the supreme state.\n\nSikh historical writings, unauthentic writings or apocryphal compositions written under the names of Sikh Gurus and other writings by Sikhs are not considered Gurbani and are referred to as Kachi Bani.[2]\n\ngurbani kirtan\",\"gurbani\",\"kirtan\",\"shabad kirtan\",\"shabad gurbani\",\"kirtan gurbani\",\"gurbani shabad\",\"shabad\",\"shabad kirtan 2018\",\"non stop kirtan\",\"popular shabads\",\"beautiful shabads\",\"devotional compilations\",\"compilation\",\"bhai\",\"sikhism\",\"prayers\",\"gurbani videos\",\"kirtan videos\",\"online gurbani\",\"shabadkirtan\",\"sikhism videos\",\"listen kirtan online\",\"non stop gurbani\",\"best gurbani kirtan\",\"punjabi gurbani\",\"kirtan download\",\"gurbani mp3\",\"old shabad kirtan\",\"shabad download\",\"non stop\",\"top Gurbani shabad\",\"Gurbani\",\"Shabad\",\"Gurbani shabad kirtan\",\"Gurbani shabad 2018\",\"live Gurbani shabad\",\"Gurbani shabad bhai\",\"Gurbani shabad songs\",\"Gurbani shabad new\",\"live kirtan\",\"live gurbani\",\"live shabad kirtan\",\"live gurbani shabad\",\"live kirtan katha\",\"shabad gurbani live\",\"kirtan gubani live\",\"shabad kirtan live\",\"golden temple live\",\"darbar sahib live\",\"live darbar sahib\",\"Latest punjabi shabad\",\"Live kirtan daily\",\"Non stop gurbani #thePunjablive [\"gurbani kirtan\",\"gurbani\",\"kirtan\",\"shabad kirtan\",\"shabad gurbani\",\"kirtan gurbani\",\"gurbani shabad\",\"shabad\",\"shabad kirtan 2018\",\"non stop kirtan\",\"popular shabads\",\"beautiful shabads\",\"devotional compilations\",\"compilation\",\"bhai\",\"sikhism\",\"prayers\",\"gurbani videos\",\"kirtan videos\",\"online gurbani\",\"shabadkirtan\",\"sikhism videos\",\"listen kirtan online\",\"non stop gurbani\",\"best gurbani kirtan\",\"punjabi gurbani\",\"kirtan download\",\"gurbani mp3\",\"old shabad kirtan\",\"shabad download\",\"non stop\"

'Divers explore the magical underwater world of Roat\u00E1n, Honduras Roat\u00E1n is one of Honduras\u2019s Caribbean Bay Islands. Being part of the huge Mesoamerican Barrier Reef, it is known for its beautiful white sand beaches, scuba diving sites and marine life, including whale sharks. In the southwest is busy West Bay Beach, with a coral reef near the shore which is where Brent and Elsa found themselves on this day in November 2018. Boarding a panga boat in west bay they scooted to the very near dive site called ZIGZAG. Descending below the waves brought Brent and Elsa an amazing dive with some gorgeous creatures common in the area.\n\nAlthough Roatan is a small island it offers up more than 30 dive sites around its perimeter. Intriguing names such as Turtle Crossing, Spooky Channel and Green Outhouse Reef are just a few of the dive locations you will find around the reef. Thinking about exploring Honduras Bay Islands and possibly specifically Roatan? The first explorer in history to land here was Christopher Columbus in 1502. He was not the first one there though, the people known as the Paya Indians are known to have inhabited these beautiful islands back as far as 600 AD. Whether a scuba diving enthusiast or someone that just loves to travel and explore, Roatan has a lot to offer for such a small island.\n\nNot a snorkeler or diver? The west bay has some great shops offering up some beautiful handmade treasures or sit on the gorgeous sandy beaches and enjoy a cold drink with your toes in the Caribbean waters. Are you a daredevil? Take in a jet ski tour racing through the local bays. You can also get harnessed up for a speedy slide on the zip lines at Monkey Trail Canopy at Gumbalimba Park. Foodie? Well there are definitely some great restaurants and beach side bars offering up some local treats of seafood and a local specialty called Baleadas. These are homemade flour tortillas filled with beans and cheese and are just $1! Try them with avocado, eggs, chicken or meat.\n\nSource & embed code: https:\/\/rumble.com\/v6xscs-divers-explore-the-magical-underwater-world-of-roatan-honduras.html.\n\nFor licensing, please email licensing@rumble.com.

'Diving with Bumphead Parrotfish Bali, Buceo, Nurkowanie, Diving with Bumphead Parrotfish in Bali, Tulamben USAT \"LIberty\" Wreck. The wreck has been completely colonised by coral during the 50 years that it has spent in the Tulamben waters. During almost 20 years, it was simply stranded on the beach and rusted, the paint freeing itself bit by bit from the steel plates. The marine paint having been made to avoid the formation of life, coral and algae, many wrecks where the paint has remained relatively intact in the world have not been able to be colonised by as much coral, which makes the Liberty wreck unique. We can find multicoloured gorgonias of a couple of meters at a depth of 12 and 14 meters, on the front section of the ship. Life is everywhere on the wreck! You will see humphead parrot fish, schools of trevally, Leaf scorpion fish, pygmee sea horses, giant barracuda, frog fish, groupers, jack fish, angel fish, black tip and white tip sharks. If you are very lucky you may even encounter a whale shark, an eagle ray or even a Mola!\n\n\nThanks for the music tracks to:\n\"Boards\" -  Francis Preve\n\"New Land\" - ALBIS\n\"St. Francis\" - Josh Lippi & The Overtimers\n\"Stranger\" - Francis Preve\n\"Plaindnes\" - Francis Preve\n\"Blue Macaw\" - Quincas Moreira\n\nI have more scuba diving videos and underwater footage on my Youtube chael\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCWhkU8IjpSY0lXBnqf0R-og\/videos?view_as=subscriber&shelf_id=0&view=0&sort=dd [\"Diving with Bumphead Parrotfish Bali\",\"Buceo\",\"Nurkowanie\",\"Diving in Bali\",\"Buceo Bali\",\"Nurkowanie na Bali\",\"Scubadivind\",\"Bumphead Parrotfish\",\"Bali\",\"Tulamben\",\"Indonesia\",\"USAT Liberty\"

'Amazing Facts, Animal Life, 19 The hammerhead sharks are named for the unusual and distinctive structure of their heads. Unlike most sharks, hammerheads usually swim in schools during the day, becoming solitary hunters at night.\n\nThe megamouth shark is an extremely rare species of deep water shark, swam at a depth of around 120 - 160m during day & at nights at depths of between 12 & 25m.\n\nThe whale shark is a slow-moving filter feeding shark & is the world\'s largest shark at about 20m long, but it is a harmless giant.\n\nTiger sharks are apex predators & they eat almost anything, which includes tyres, bottles, clothes, human flesh etc.\n\nThe Japanese spider crab has the greatest leg span of any arthropod, reaching 3.8m from claw to claw. The body may grow to a size of 40cm and the whole crab can weigh up to 19kg.\n\nThe dresser crab or decorator crab usually found covered in seaweed, sponges & other sea creatures that acts as a camouflage.\n\nEvery year in the Christmas Island, roads are forced to be closed because of a massive migration of red crabs.\n\nScorpions glow in the dark & look neon blue if seen it in the moon light.\n\nThe Eurasian reed warbler is one of the species that are brood parasitized (rely on others to raise their young), by common cuckoo.\n\nThe colourful and large bill, which is some large species measures more than half the length of the body, is the hallmark of toucans.\n\nSociable weaver birds build large compound community nests, a rarity among birds & the nest measures about 20ft wide and 10ft high.\n\nRuppell\'s griffon vulture - the highest flying bird ever, has been found at heights up to 11,300m (37,000 ft).\n\nThere are about 18 species of penguin, most of them living in huge colonies called \'Rookeries\' along the coast of Antarctica & nearby islands.\n\nAlex - an African grey parrot, learned to count, sort out shapes & say more than 100 words, but died in 2007, at the age of 31 (average life span for African grey parrots is 60 years).\n\nLacking teeth, ostriches swallow pebbles to grind their food and an adult ostrich carries about 1 kg of stones in its stomach.\n\nKookaburra is the terrestrial tree kingfishers native to Australia and New Guinea & its loud call sounds like echoing human laughter.\n\nMushrooms such as Stinkhorn\'s spores has a smell of rotting meat or even poo, which attract flies and other insects to help disperse the spores.\n\nFungi can grow in soil, on old wood, around baths or on our feet & toenails.\n\nA frog\'s two front legs have four toes each, while the back legs have five toes each.\n\nGoliath Frog lacks a vocal sac and so cannot make any sound.\n\nOctopuses are the first invertebrates to be seen using tools, such as using coconut shells to hide from potential predators.\n\nThe mimic octopus possesses the unique behaviour of taking shape of various animals such as flatfish, jellyfish, stingray, seahorse or deadly sea snake.\n\nOctopuses have three hearts. Two branchial hearts pump blood through each of the two gills, while the third is a systemic heart that pumps blood through the body.\n\nAn octopus can open a screw-top bottle or jar with its tentacles.\n\nWandering albatrosses spend most of their life in flight, landing only to breed and feed. Distances travelled each year are hard to measure, but one banded bird was recorded travelling 6000 km in twelve days.\n\nThe brown skua also known as the Antarctic skua is a large seabird that breeds in the sub Antarctic and Antarctic zones, eats penguin eggs and even trash.\n\nThe ribbon-tailed astrapia is medium-sized only up to 32 cm long, but it has the longest tail than any other bird at 1 m long.\n\nArctic birds keep warm by standing on one leg & tucking their head under a wing.\n\nThe most obvious characteristic of the flatfish is its asymmetry, with both eyes lying on the same side of the head in the adult fish. In some families, the eyes are usually on the right side of the body and in others, they are usually on the left.\n\nA flying fish spent 45 seconds in a single flight & the flights are typically around 50m. They can use updrafts at the leading edge of waves to cover distances of up to 400m at speeds of more than 70 km\/hr & at the maximum altitude is 6m above the surface of the sea.

'solo female travel philippines part 2: oslob whale shark watching + moalboal canyoneering in part 2 of my philippines solo female travel video  i visited oslob and moalboal.  i traveled to oslob specifically to see the whale sharks that are fed by the locals to attract tourists. even though i have scuba dived over 100 times  i had never seen a whale shark. the whale shark feeding was a unique experience with pros and cons. im so blessed to experience these gentle giants  even though their environment in oslob seemed stressful to the animals.  in moalboal i went on the famous canyoneering tours. i was so proud of myself for being able to jump from a 55 foot tall cliff! especially because i was traveling with my new filipino friend  jamaica  canyoneering was one of my most fun days traveling in the philippines. i highly recommend it.  finally  i went to see the epic sardine run off the coast of moalboal. as these fish danced in the sunset  i felt like i could hear the rhythm of their symphony.  meeting jamaicas family and experiencing the depth of filipino poverty was a shocking wake up call for me. it made me realize how blessed i am. thank you  jamaica.  check out part 1 of my philippines trip to malapascua and balicasag  bohol here: https:\/\/youtu.be\/iceicqiuwl8  music  song: lakey inspired - chill day (vlog no copyright music) music provided by vlog no copyright music. video link: https:\/\/youtu.be\/vthgesuq22s  fresh by ikson https:\/\/www.soundcloud.com\/ikson music promoted by audio library https:\/\/youtu.be\/v5bc7ehuahc [philippines solo female travel oslob whale shark moalboal scuba snorkel canyoneering sardine run gopro

He had seen these majestic creatures\u2014the world\u2019s largest fish\u2014swim alongside his ship during the week-long journey in the Indian Ocean.\n\nDecades after, when a middle-aged Pandey drove along the Gujarat coastline asking people about the \u201Cbig fish\u201D, which did not have a local name, no one knew what he was talking about. Then, in 1996, a builder of fibreglass boats in Bhavnagar described the beautifully patterned fish accurately and said that in some villages, people hunted it on occasion. Locals did not eat the fish, but they used oil from the liver to waterproof wooden boats.\n\nPerhaps the boat-builder was unaware of more recent developments: From 1991 onwards, whale sharks had been killed in large numbers in Gujarat, fuelled by the demand for their fins and meat in South-east Asia and Europe.\n\nIn any case, after the chat with the builder, the quest began in earnest. In 1998, Pandey sighted his first whale shark in the murky waters of the Veraval harbour. As large as a trawler, it lay cut open. Two men who had clambered on were hacking at its insides. As life ebbed out of the hapless fish, Pandey remembers making a silent pledge: he would save the gentle giants of the Gujarat coast.\n\nPandey\u2019s crew went about filming the hunting of the whale shark. In 2000, the resulting documentary \u201CShores of Silence\u201D won the Wildscreen Panda Award, the equivalent of the Oscar for natural history films (watch it here) One year later, after intense lobbying, the Indian government banned the killing of whale sharks.\n\nThat was not all. In 2002, at a gathering of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), even as the conference was winding down, the panel agreed to a re-vote on whale sharks. After watching Pandey\u2019s documentary, an overwhelming majority voted to put the fish on a list of species not in immediate danger of extinction, but in need of trade restrictions in order to ensure their survival.\n\nIn India, the whale shark was already on a par with the charismatic tiger, as far as legal protection goes. But three years into the ban, a survey along the Gujarat coast showed that even in Veraval, the hub of the whale shark fisheries, few knew of its status.\n\nA \u201CSave the Whale Sharks\u201D movement was launched in Gujarat in 2004, to change attitudes towards the fish that visits its shores from September to May. The campaign was a joint venture of the Wildlife Trust of India-International Fund for Animal Welfare (WTI-IFAW), Tata Chemicals Ltd and the Gujarat forest department.\n\nWhale shark, the largest known fish species. Photo: Venkat Charloo\nMorari Bapu, a spiritual leader revered by many in Gujarat, became a campaign ambassador. At the launch, he spoke about the tradition of non-violence and the idea of honouring guests. Warming to the theme, he equated the visits of whale shark to a beloved daughter coming home to give birth to her child.\n\nThis metaphor became the theme for a street play which featured a fisherman, a potential hunter of whale sharks, whose pregnant daughter comes home to deliver her baby. The plot linked the fate of the fish and that of the daughter, so ultimately the fisherman resolves to save and protect both.\n\nWith the play becoming a hit in the fishing villages, the fish known as \u201Cbarrel\u201D became vhali, meaning \u201Cdear one\u201D, which was the name of the daughter in the play. A 4oft inflatable whale shark, which served as the backdrop, drew in the crowds. Inland, too, kids loved the life-sized model of vhali. They touched it and wanted to know more about the fish.\n\nPorbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, was [\"asiatic\",\"lion\",\"lioness\",\"cubs\",\"leopard\",\"python\",\"cat\",\"dog\",\"dear\",\"wildlife\",\"animal\",\"attack\",\"sasan\",\"gir\",\"girnar\",\"flora-fauna\",\"forest\",\"national\",\"park\",\"sanctuary\",\"mating\",\"safari\",\"junagadh\",\"junagarh\",\"gujarat\",\"india\",\"rescue\",\"jambur\",\"siddi\",\"tribes\",\"african\",\"license\",\"stock\",\"footage\",\"licensing\",\"Jungle\",\"floods\",\"rain\",\"biodiversity\",\"narendra\",\"modi\",\"great\",\"rare\",\"amezing\",\"unique\",\"\u0936\u0947\u0930\",\"\u090F\u0936\u093F\u092F\u093E\u0908\",\"\u092C\u092C\u094D\u092C\u0930\",\"\u0936\u0947\u0930\u0928\u0940\",\"\u0938\u0902\u092D\u094B\u0917\",\"\u0936\u093E\u0935\u0915\",\"\u0924\u0947\u0902\u0926\u0941\u0906\",\"\u091C\u0902\u0917\u0932\",\"\u0938\u093E\u0938\u0928\",\"\u0917\u093F\u0930\",\"\u0917\u0941\u091C\u0930\u093E\u0924\",\"\u0928\u0930\u0947\u0928\u094D\u0926\u094D\u0930\",\"\u092E\u094B\u0926\u0940\",\"\u0905\u0926\u092D\u0941\u0924\",\"\u0926\u0941\u0930\u094D\u0932\u092D\",\"\u0905\u092D\u0942\u0924\u092A\u0942\u0930\u094D\u0935\",\"\u0905\u0926\u094D\u0935\u093F\u0924\u0940\u092F\",\"\u092B\u093E\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094D\u091F\",\"\u0935\u0928\u0938\u094D\u092A\u0924\u093F\",\"\u091C\u0940\u0935\",\"\u091C\u0942\u0928\u093E\u0917\u095D\",\"\u092D\u093E\u0930\u0924\"

'sharks protect sharks marine policy suggest that around 100 million sharks are killed every year by humans. this number might be vast beyond comprehension but the journal also recognises that it is a conservative estimate and it could by closer to 273 million killed each year. taking the 100 million estimate  it works out at 11 416 sharks killed across the globe every single hour. (metro.co.uk)  shark killing has to end because ...as apex predators  sharks play an important role in the ecosystem by maintaining the species below them in the food chain and serving as an indicator for ocean health. they help remove the weak and the sick as well as keeping the balance with competitors helping to ensure species diversity. by taking sharks out of the coral reef ecosystem  the larger predatory fish  such as groupers  increase in abundance and feed on the herbivores. with less herbivores  macroalgae expands and coral can no longer compete  shifting the ecosystem to one of algae dominance  affecting the survival of the reef system.

'Baby red crabs return! Guess who\'s back?!! This morning, millions of tiny baby Christmas Island red crabs have started to drift up onto the shoreline around this incredible island! A month ago, the adult crabs all spawned billions of eggs into the sea, and these little guys have been drifting around in the ocean\u2019s currents hoping that they don\u2019t get eaten by lurking whale sharks and also hoping that this will be one of the years when the currents miraculously bring them back to the island just as they start to transform from free-swimming little Megalopes into mini crabs! These guys are the lucky survivors, clambering ashore to head up into the jungle to live out their lives as land crabs, cleaning the forest floor. After they mature in about 5 years, these guys will join the 50-million adult red crabs in their annual migration down to the sea to spawn, in a spectacular event Sir David Attenborough describes as one of the Top 10 natural wonders on Earth. Maybe visit next Dec\/Jan\/Feb and stay at the luxurious new eco-retreat Swell Lodge on the coast inside the national park to be right in the heart of this extraordinary event!

'Diving Thailand 26 January 2019  Sail Rock Underwater video Considered the premier dive site in the Gulf of Thailand, Sail Rock  is a pinnacle which rises to 15m above and 40m below the surface. Sail Rock lies between Koh Phangan and Koh tao. It\'s famous for its natural underwater vertical swim through or chimney which divers can enter at 6 metres and exit at 18.

'enormous whale shark descends through divers from above scuba divers from all around the world consider the galapagos islands to be one of their bucket list travel destinations. there are many reasons that they feel the allure of this world. it could be the hammerheads that congregate in enormous schools  the sea turtles in abundance  the harsh  yet beautiful landscape that has caused such unique adaptations in the animal life. for many  it is the chance to see whale sharks  the biggest shark in the ocean and one of the largest animals alive. the galapagos provide a very real possibility of encountering one or two. the three distinct ocean currents that converge here bring an abundance of food and create ideal conditions for whale sharks during certain months.  imagine the dream coming true for these divers as they are carried along on the current  exploring the waters around darwin island  one of the most iconic locations in the world. a large shadow appeared over their heads and they realized that not only were they seeing one of the majestic beasts above  but she was descending right toward them. she is a large  pregnant female  over fifty feet in length. possibly curious  possibly somehow aware of their admiration  she circles slowly as she dives  passing through their bubbles and among the group. some of the divers had ascended to 60 feet  as the dive was nearing its end. others remained at eighty feet. incredibly  this whale shark spiraled downward  giving them all a breathtaking view as she did so. from the cameraman\u2019s point of view  the divers below were only partially visible but their bubbles show their position and the whale shark can be seen gracefully passing by them.  the divers below couldn\u2019t resist and they sank slowly with her  prolonging the encounter as much as they could. for a scuba diver  such a meeting is unforgettable and extremely emotional.  source & embed code: https:\/\/rumble.com\/v6vusm-whale-shark-descends-through-divers.html.  for licensing  please email licensing@rumble.com.

'[unknown] Snorkeling: MANTA RAYS are simply majestic creatures (Nusa Penida - Bali)\n\nSnorkeling with manta rays is truely an experience you should not miss in Bali. It is so incredible how these big creatures fly in the water. You can book a manta ray snorkeling tour anywhere. Yet you should know that the snorkeling is at the coast Nusa Penida, an island very close to Bali. Actually many instagram photos are from here!\nWhen you see the film, you will notice all the stuff floating in the water. It is not all trash, but still way too much. I think it is important that people can see theses majestic animals but on the other hand may be they should clean up as well when they dive into the water world.

'7 Unanswered Questions About Sharks 7 Unanswered Questions About Sharks:wildlife discovery.\n\nwildlife videos:https:\/\/youtu.be\/QuCfGfTkl-s\n\n7 Unanswered Questions About Sharks\n\nShark mysteries\nAsk any shark biologist a question about sharks, and chances are, the answer will begin with, \"We\'re not really sure, but\u2026\"\nThat\'s because researchers know remarkably little about these deep-ocean creatures. There are more than 400 species of shark, and many of them fare poorly in captivity, making it difficult to observe their mating, navigational, learning and social (or anti-social) behavior.\nIn celebration of the Discovery Channel\'s \"Shark Week,\" here are seven mysteries that scientists have yet to solve about sharks.\n\n1) How do sharks navigate?\nThe open ocean has few visual cues, so how do sharks know where they\'re going? Some sharks travel great distances, such as the great white sharks that swim across the Indian Ocean, from the west coast of Australia to South Africa, said Andrew Nosal, a postdoctoral researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the Birch Aquarium.\n\"It is an enduring mystery how sharks find their way through the ocean, which environmental cues they use, and how exactly those cues are detected and integrated,\" Nosal told Live Science.\nThere is compelling evidence that some sharks use geomagnetic navigation, meaning that they can sense Earth\'s magnetic field, orient to it and use it as a navigational tool, he said. Olfaction (smell) may be another navigational tool that some sharks use. But perhaps other factors \u2014 such as water temperature, sound and even vision (to some extent) \u2014 may help sharks navigate the deep, Nosal said.\n\n2) How many species exist?\nResearchers are still discovering new species of shark, especially from the deep ocean.\n\"These habitats are so mysterious because they are so removed from human activity,\" Nosal said. \"We still don\'t know what lives there.\"\nFor instance, the so-called ninja shark (Etmopterus benchleyi) was announced to the scientific world in December 2015; a newfound species of hammerhead shark (Sphyrna gilberti) off the coast of South Carolina was identified in 2013; and a new species of \"walking\" shark (Hemiscyllium halmahera), shown here, made headlines after researchers discovered it in a reef off an Indonesian island, according to a 2013 study in the Journal of Ichthyology.\nMoreover, sharks can range greatly in size, from as small as a cigar to as large as a school bus (such as the whale shark, a plankton feeder). They also live in diverse habitats, so a newfound species could be uncovered anywhere, Nosal said.\n\n3) Why do sharks migrate?\nIt\'s clear that many sharks migrate seasonally, different trackers show. But why these fish migrate is still a mystery.\n\"We\'ve got great technology that tells us where they are going,\" said Gregory Skomal, a fisheries biologist with the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries. \"But we don\'t know what drives the migration.\"\nDo sharks migrate for food, mating, temperature or perhaps a mixture of all three? It\'s hard to say, even after studying a handful of sharks within the same species, Nosal said.\n\"I might track 10 leopard sharks, and they all do something that\'s a little bit different,\" Nosal said. \"It\'s hard to pull out the patterns to explain what\'s going on.\"\nOnly by studying vast numbers of a single species of shark can researchers find overall trends and perhaps tease out the reasons behind each migration, he said...\n\nAccording to Live Science.\n\nThank you for watching!\n\nDon\'t forget to like this video, and subscribe for the next video.\n\n#researchsciences [\"Unanswered\",\"Questions\",\"Sharks\",\"science daily\",\"science articles\",\"interesting science articles\",\"21 news\",\"news information knowledge\",\"news documentary\",\"endtime news update today\",\"end times news\",\"breaking news today\",\"21 news channel and friends\",\"21 new channel\",\"community news\",\"today\",\"news\",\"knowledge\",\"science\"

Sail Rock lies between Koh Phangan and Koh tao. It\'s famous for its natural underwater vertical swim through or chimney which divers can enter at 6 metres and exit at 18. It is also the visiting site of many larger pelagic fish  including chevron barracuda, big schools of mackerel, jacks, trevally and tuna. You may encounter a seasonal whale shark with over 40 spotted at Sail Rock in 2013 alone.  Giant moray eels and lion fish have also taken up residency.

'The Maldives - Scuba Liveaboard, Hulhumale, Private Islands, Ep. 21 After hiking the Annapurna Circuit and relaxing for a few days in Kathmandu we flew to the exact opposite environment landing in the Maldives. We boarded a 7 day scuba liveaboard and set off towards the atolls. The scenery was blue in all directions and light turquoise around the island protected reefs. There were thousands of islands, each one more picturesque then the one we just left. We had some rain and rough seas, but that didn\u2019t really effect our dives since we were underwater. Also, we are about a month out of season, which is why we were able to afford this deeply discounted ship. All in all we did so many dives for us that it would be almost too much. We pushed our limits of decompression diving, saw some amazing underwater marine life, and went searching unsuccessfully for the Whaleshark.\n\nSummary of our dive logs:\n\nLankan Paradiss, North Maw Atoll \/\/ 22 meters, 57 minutes \/\/ 5 manta, turtle, octopus, eel\nKandooma Thila, South Male \/\/ 32.2 meters, 42 minutes \/\/ 2 sharks\nAlimathy Jetty, Vaauu Atoll \/\/ 13.6 meters, 43 minutes \/\/ night dive with Nurse sharks everywhere\nMyrna Kandu, Vaauu Atoll \/\/ 32 meters, 52 minutes \/\/ drift dive, 2 eels, pooping parrotfish\nKudu Rah Thilla, South Ari Atoll \/\/ 27.4 meters, 49 minutes \/\/ nudi branch, 2 octopus, 6 sharks\nBroken Rock, South Ari Atoll \/\/ 27.4 meters, 55 minutes \/\/ white tip and black tip reef sharks, Phantom Bannerfish school\nDiggunah boyro, South Ari Atoll \/\/ 25.1 meters, 54 minutes \/\/ No whaleshark, scorpionfish, nudibranch, eels\nRadiggah Thila, South Atoll \/\/ 29 meters, 47 minutes \/\/ large school of barracuda\nMoo Fushi Corner, North Ari Atoll \/\/ 33.6 meters, 55 minutes \/\/ 20-30 black tip reef sharks, 2 safety stops\nMoo Fushi Corner, North Ari Atoll second dive \/\/ 37.8 meters, 44 minutes \/\/ 10 reef sharks, 25 eagle rays, 2 safety stops\nFesdhoo Wreck, North Ari Atoll \/\/ 31.2 meters, 44 minutes \/\/ wreck dive, eels, manta, octopus, harlequin sweetlips\nFish Head, North Ari Atoll \/\/ 33 meters, 61 minutes \/\/ reef sharks, octopus\nMaaya Thila \/\/ 31 meters, 51 minutes \/\/ 10 sharks, 2 eagle rays, 2 turtles, nudibranch, octopus\nBatala Kanthila \/\/ 22.1 meters, 60 minutes \/\/ sharks, triggerfish, octopus, nudibranch\nLion Head, Maldives \/\/ 35.3 meters, 51 minutes \/\/ drift dive, wall dive, last dive\n\nNext \/\/ We charter a boat in Lefkada, Greece and sail around the Ionian sea\n\nMusic:\nHow About Nah \/\/ roljui\nMuffled Tines \/\/ roljui\n\nhttp:\/\/www.wherewejoy.com [\"maldives\",\"hulhumale\",\"private islands\",\"liveaboard\",\"scuba\",\"scuba dive\",\"manta\",\"shark\",\"whaleshark\",\"atolls\",\"decompression\"

'Whale Shark at  Sail Rock 07 July 2017 Underwater video Considered the premier dive site in the Gulf of Thailand, Sail Rock  is a pinnacle which rises to 15m above and 40m below the surface. Sail Rock lies between Koh Phangan and Koh tao. It\'s famous for its natural underwater vertical swim through or chimney which divers can enter at 6 metres and exit at 18. It is also the visiting site of many larger pelagic fish  including chevron barracuda, big schools of mackerel, jacks, trevally and tuna. You may encounter a seasonal whale shark with over 40 spotted at Sail Rock in 2013 alone.  Giant moray eels and lion fish have also taken up residency. The Trigger fish are also very playful during their nesting period!\n\nhttps:\/\/www.pond5.com\/artist\/Kovban\nhttp:\/\/hinbhairesort.com\nhttp:\/\/en.fotolia.com\/p\/203930711\/partner\/203930711 [\"Sail\",\"Rock\",\"diving\",\"underwater\",\"video\",\"fish\",\"whale\",\"\u043A\u0438\u0442\u043E\u0432\u0430\u044F\",\"\u0430\u043A\u0443\u043B\u0430\",\"\uACE0\uB798\",\"\uC0C1\uC5B4\",\"shark\",\"\u0E09\u0E25\u0E32\u0E21\u0E27\u0E32\u0E2C\",\"PADI\",\"course\",\"IDC\",\"center\",\"star\",\"BullShark\",\"dive\",\"barracuda\",\"funny\",\"grouper\",\"angel\",\"bigeye\",\"maclel\",\"queenfish\",\"undersea\",\"coral\",\"jellyfish\",\"\u30B8\u30F3\u30D9\u30A4\u30B6\u30E1\",\"starfish\",\"wether\",\"report\",\"aquatic\",\"manta\",\"ray\",\"\u043F\u043E\u0434\u0432\u043E\u0434\u043D\u043E\u0435\",\"\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043E\"

'the biggest fish in the sea  the whaleshark (rhincodon typus)  koh tao  thailand. the whale shark (rhincodon typus) is a slow-moving  filter-feeding carpet shark and the largest known extant fish species. the largest confirmed individual had a length of 12.65 m (41.5 ft) and a weight of about 21.5 t (47 000 lb). the whale shark holds many records for size in the animal kingdom  most notably being by far the largest living nonmammalian vertebrate. it is the sole member of the genus rhincodon and the only extant member of the family rhincodontidae which belongs to the subclass elasmobranchii in the class chondrichthyes. before 1984 it was classified as rhiniodon into rhinodontidae.  the whale shark is found in open waters of the tropical oceans and is rarely found in water below 21 \u00B0c (70 \u00B0f).[2] modeling suggests a lifespan of about 70 years  but measurements have proven difficult.[9] whale sharks have very large mouths and are filter feeders  which is a feeding mode that occurs in only two other sharks  the megamouth shark and the basking shark. they feed almost exclusively on plankton and small fishes  and pose no threat to humans.  cjeck out my facebook & instaggram for more photos & videos. https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/videoandphotowtc\/ https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/wtc.productions\/ [whalehark rhincodon typus koh tao scuba diving koh tao diving koh tao diving schools diving school scuba diving certification scuba diving course diving lessons scuba shop diving certification diving in thailand padi courses dive shop koh tao ko tao koh tao thailand scuba diving scuba what is scuba diving best diving in thailand diving big blue diving koh thai padi koh phangan big blue bigblue thailand koh tao

'#17 swim with sharks\/things to do before you die subscribe: https:\/\/goo.gl\/jhyia6 marlen rivera: ive dived for over 30 years and countless times ive swam with sharks. i have shared with these incredible animals in san bernardo  providencia  malpelo  gorgona  curacao  mexico... i think of the best swims  the one i made next to the whale shark is unforgettable. being by his side is indescribable. with its 12 meters long one only feels how small and aggressive humans can be  because a whale shark is as big as meek. nothing could threaten a giant like this. definitely snorkeling in general is a life experience and if it is next to sharks  better. its the best-invested talk.

'Amazing Experience With Humpback Whales Exmouth 2017 With Nigaloo Whale Shark Swim Tours When we swam with the whales my GoPro decided to stop functioning so unfortunately, I was unable to get footage from under the water. However, we did manage to capture some incredible footage from the boat.\n\nWe experienced a mother and calf trapped in an epic battle with two giant males, at times within just a few meters from the boat. This lasted maybe 30 minutes or longer but was hard to tell with all of the excitement.\n\nSwimming with the whales was an unforgettable experience but this absolutely made the trip worthwhile for me. A big thanks to all of the team at Ningaloowhalesharks.com for an incredible day and great company.\n\nMusic by www.bensound.com [\"humpback whales\",\"swimming\",\"humpback\",\"whalesharks\",\"whale shark\",\"whale\",\"exmouth\",\"swimming with humpback whales\",\"ningaloo\",\"experience\",\"travel\",\"australia\",\"traveling australia\",\"ocean\",\"snorkelling\",\"snorkeling\",\"travelling\",\"travelling australia\"

'Diving Thailand Sail Rock 13 October 2018  Underwater video Considered the premier dive site in the Gulf of Thailand, Sail Rock  is a pinnacle which rises to 15m above and 40m below the surface. Sail Rock lies between Koh Phangan and Koh tao. It\'s famous for its natural underwater vertical swim through or chimney which divers can enter at 6 metres and exit at 18. It is also the visiting site of many larger pelagic fish  including chevron barracuda, big schools of mackerel, jacks, trevally and tuna.

'swimming with my whale shark family... sorry for the unclear 360 4k footage you need to move the screen around to see the whales...  -----  finally got to meet up with some aquatic family in the gulf of mexico this past trip..was wild.  as we headed out dolphins suddenly appeared by our boat swimming alongside us (you can one jumping at the very beginning).  we circled for an hour but the two whale sharks were feeding down below and werent surfacing until the very end. then we jumped in two by two!  these are enormous creatures  look at the size of us by them! on my way back to the boat my swim partner called out  look hes right under us and i dived back in.  sure enough he was basking with his massive mouth wide open and had come straight behind us following our trail back to the boat. my camera was literally in his mouth and i had to pull back so as to stay circling him. (of course i panicked and hit the record button again so that switched off the video and you cant see how close he came to me..duh  sorry about that).  the two sharks hung around really relaxed in our company; it was majestic.  ---  whale sharks have unique spots on their backs and bellies similar to human fingerprints making each individual identifiable. they are not a mammal as whales are  but the largest fish in the ocean  laying eggs rather than birthing live young as whales do. the term shark comes from the shape of the fins and their bodies but technically they are closer to filter feeding whales at 40 feet long rather than carnivorous sharks.  --  music by christopher comstock https:\/\/www.reverbnation.com\/chrisvcomstock [whale sharks the gypsie princess scuba divers snorkeling stargate swimming aquatic marine life gulf of mexico chris comstock

'giant whale shark in thousand islands-jakarta it\u2019s sometimes easy to forget that jakarta is actually a coastal city  one that extends out into the sea thanks to the thousand islands and the bay of jakarta. many jakartans still make their livings as fishermen and many oppose the jakarta bay reclamation project as they fear it will destroy their livelihoods.  while the number of fish in jakarta bay may already be decreasing due to the project (not to mention pollution)  it certainly hasn\u2019t scared off all of them  as evidenced by this video of an astonished group of divers encountering a giant whale shark  a member of the largest living species of fish  while they were diving around thousand islands.  dharmadi  a researcher at the ministry of maritime affairs and fisheries specializing in sharks and rays  said the  whale shark\u2019s presence in jakarta bay was quite rare but not unprecedented.  \u201Ci suspect  the presence of whale sharks was because of the food \u201D dharmadi told detik  adding that whale sharks usually stay in deep waters but often go into shallower areas in search of food  mainly plankton and small fish  which can be dangerous if they get stuck somewhere during low tide.

So join our finger family for nursery rhymes learning and fun games with color changing Finding Dory toys!\n\ninding Dory is a 2016 American 3D computer-animated comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures.\n\nDory, a regal blue tang, gets separated from her parents as a child. As she grows up, Dory attempts to search for them, but gradually forgets them due to her short-term memory loss disability. In the flashback of the previous film, Finding Nemo, after accidentally running into Marlin, a clownfish who is looking for his missing son, Nemo, she joins him on his journey.\n\nOne year later, Dory has joined Marlin and Nemo on their reef. One day, Dory has a flashback and remembers that she has parents. She decides to look for them, but finds her memory problem an obstacle. She remembers that they lived at the Jewel of Morro Bay across the ocean in California.\n\nMarlin and Nemo accompany Dory. With the help of Crush, a sea turtle friend, they ride a water current to California. Upon arrival, Dory accidentally awakens a squid, who immediately pursues them, almost devouring Nemo. Marlin berates Dory for endangering them. Her feelings hurt, Dory travels to the surface to seek help and is captured by staff members from the nearby Marine Life Institute after getting entangled in six pack rings.\n\nDory is placed in the quarantine section and tagged. There she meets a grouchy but well-meaning octopus named Hank. Dory\'s tag shows that she will be sent to an aquarium in Cleveland. Due to a traumatic ocean life, Hank wants to live in the aquarium instead of being released back into the ocean, so he agrees to help Dory find her parents in exchange for her tag. In one exhibit, Dory encounters her childhood friend Destiny, a nearsighted whale shark who used to communicate with Dory through pipes, and Bailey, a beluga whale who mistakenly believes he has lost his ability to echolocate. Dory subsequently has flashbacks of life with her parents and struggles to recall details. She finally remembers how she was separated from her parents: she overheard her mother crying one night, left to retrieve a shell to cheer her up, and was pulled away by an undertow current.\n\nMarlin and Nemo attempt to rescue Dory. With the help of two sea lions named Fluke and Rudder and a disfigured common loon named Becky, they manage to get into the institute and find her in the pipe system. Other blue tangs tell them that Dory\'s parents escaped from the institute a long time ago to search for her and never came back, leaving Dory believing that they have died. Hank retrieves Dory from the tank, accidentally leaving Marlin and Nemo behind. He is then apprehended by one of the employees and unintentionally drops Dory into the drain, flushing her out to the ocean. While wandering aimlessly, she comes across a trail of shells; remembering that when she was young, her parents had set out a similar trail to help her find her way back home, she follows it. At the end of the trail, Dory finds an empty home with multiple shell trails leading to it. As she turns to leave, she sees her parents Jenny and Charlie in the distance. They tell her they spent years laying down the trails for her to follow in the hopes that she would eventually find them.\n\nMarlin, Nemo, and Hank end up in the truck taking various aquatic creatures to Cleveland. Destiny and Bailey escape from their exhibit to help Dory rescue them. Once on board the truck, Dory persuades Hank to return to the sea with her, and together, they hijack the truck and drive it over busy highways, creating havoc, before crashing it into the ocean, freeing all the fish. Dory, along with her parents and new friends, return to the reef with Marlin and Nemo.\n\nHere\'s how to say Disney Finding Dory in other languages: \u062F\u064A\u0632\u0646\u064A \u0627\u0644\u0639\u062B\u0648\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062F\u0648\u0631\u064A, \u8FEA\u58EB\u5C3C\u627E\u5230dory, Disney paghahanap dory, Disney recherche dory, Disney findet dory, \u30C7\u30A3\u30BA\u30CB\u30FC\u3092\u898B\u3064\u3051\u308B\u30C9\u30EA\u30FC, \uB514\uC988\uB2C8 \uCC3E\uAE30 \uB3C4\uB9AC, Disney encontrando dory, \u0414\u0438\u0441\u043D\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442, \u0447\u0442\u043E, [\"Toon Tube\",\"Yippee toys\",\"Baby Big Mouth\",\"TheEngineeringFamily\",\"learning video\",\"juego\",\"brinquedos\",\"surpresas\",\"full episodes\",\"full movie\",\"cartoon\",\"toy review\",\"finger family\",\"nursery rhymes\",\"finding dory toys\",\"finding dory color change\",\"learn your colors\",\"learn colors\",\"finding dory surprise eggs\",\"dory colors\",\"dory color change\",\"finding nemo color change\",\"dory coloring\"

'Diving Thailand 22 October 2018 Sail Rock Underwater video Considered the premier dive site in the Gulf of Thailand, Sail Rock  is a pinnacle which rises to 15m above and 40m below the surface. Sail Rock lies between Koh Phangan and Koh tao. It\'s famous for its natural underwater vertical swim through or chimney which divers can enter at 6 metres and exit at 18. It is also the visiting site of many larger pelagic fish  including chevron barracuda, big schools of mackerel, jacks, trevally and tuna. You may encounter a seasonal whale shark with over 40 spotted at Sail Rock in 2013 alone.  Giant moray eels and lion fish have also taken up residency.

'nature guide makes dream come true for scuba diver tour guests imagine meeting not one whale shark face to face  but twelve! these scuba divers have traveled from canada to the galapagos islands for the trip of a lifetime. they embarked on a 7 day voyage aboard the galapagos sky  a tour boat that would take them to one of the most remote  hostile  and challenging environments on the planet. it is also one of the most beautiful places on earth. they were hoping for a sighting of a whale shark  the most massive and majestic shark in the ocean. it is the biggest fish and also the biggest animal in the world  with the exception of a few species of whale. they are beautiful creatures and despite their intimidating size  they are harmless and gentle. for a scuba diver  there is no greater experience than to swim with a whale shark. these divers were about to experience something beyond their wildest dreams. the tourists were under the guidance of christian rueda  a very experienced and talented nature guide and scuba diver. they are seasoned adventurers  but they needed specific training about how to dive in the strong currents in the galapagos. it took christian several days of intense instruction to increase their skills to the point that they were ready for these dives. entering the water in rough waves and strong current is not for the faint of heart. after investing so much in this trip  christian understandably felt a lot of pressure to provide them with the view of a whale shark they were hoping for. as they braved the waters around darwin island  christian was faced with the biggest challenge. actually finding these whale sharks is often a nearly impossible task. studying the conditions carefully  he chose the time and the spot and led the divers to a rock ledge under darwins arch  70 feet below the surface. incredibly  one of the massive creatures appeared on the second day. christian had the divers lined up on the wall to watch and wait. surrounded by hammerhead sharks  sea turtles and fish  it was like watching the most massive and spectacular imax screen. when the whale shark slowly cruised past on the ocean current  the divers followed their guide out into the blue to meet it face to face. what they saw and felt when they came close enough to touch this majestic animal cannot be described. for the next five days  christian found his guests whale sharks 11 more times. their experience in the waters of the galapagos islands left them in awe. this video provides us with a few highlights from their adventure. few people have ever met one of these creatures close up and even fewer have met 12 in one week.  source & embed code: https:\/\/rumble.com\/v71dre-scuba-divers-have-dream-encounter-with-whale-sharks-in-galapagos-islands.html.  for licensing  please email licensing@rumble.com.

'Whale Shark Passes Nearby, Oslob, Cebu Island, Philippines Short clip of a whale shark swimming through a dive group in Oslob, Philippines.\n\nThere is a wee bit of controversy surrounding the sharks in this area, as they are fed by locals in order to attract them to boats for tourists. The food apparently isn\'t sufficient for the whale sharks needs, and the constant supply of food stops them from migrating properly. I went along with a dive group to see the process in action, and I cannot recommend going on one of these tourist boats if you care about the welfare of these creatures.\n\nPlease also be careful of which dive company you chose to go with, some genuinely care about the sharks and will use the larger proportion of your dive fee to help with the conservation of sharks. Other dive companies are less concerned with the sharks\' wellbeing. [\"Whale Shark\",\"diving\",\"oslob\",\"philippines\",\"scuba\",\"cebu island\",\"shark\"

'29 of October 2018 at  Sail Rock Underwater video Considered the premier dive site in the Gulf of Thailand, Sail Rock  is a pinnacle which rises to 15m above and 40m below the surface. Sail Rock lies between Koh Phangan and Koh tao. It\'s famous for its natural underwater vertical swim through or chimney which divers can enter at 6 metres and exit at 18. It is also the visiting site of many larger pelagic fish  including chevron barracuda, big schools of mackerel, jacks, trevally and tuna. You may encounter a seasonal whale shark with over 40 spotted at Sail Rock in 2013 alone.  Giant moray eels and lion fish have also taken up residency.

'Iranian Fisherman Sparks Outrage By Surfing Atop Whale Shark An Iranian fisherman is experiencing backlash after posting a video that appears to show him leaping from a boat onto the back of whale shark in the Persian Gulf.\n\nAt one point the shark appears to dive deeper below the water\u2019s surface in an attempt to shake the fisherman off. But the tactic proved ineffective, as the man swims and gets back on the massive fish.\n\nThe video has received criticism online, with some viewers calling the stunt animal abuse.\n\n*****\nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

'Brave Rhino Tries to Withstand the Elephant - Wild Animals Fighting Rhino meets elephants and tries to prove that he is the owner of the territory. What will be the outcome?\n\nA rhinoceros, often abbreviated to rhino, is one of any five extant species of odd-toed ungulates in the family Rhinocerotidae, as well as any of the numerous extinct species. Two of these extant species are native to Africa and three to Southern Asia. Members of the rhinoceros family are characterized by their large size (they are some of the largest remaining megafauna, with all of the species able to reach one tonne or more in weight); as well as by an herbivorous diet; a thick protective skin, 1.5\u20135 cm thick, formed from layers of collagen positioned in a lattice structure; relatively small brains for mammals this size (400\u2013600 g); and a large horn. They generally eat leafy material, although their ability to ferment food in their hindgut allows them to subsist on more fibrous plant matter, if necessary. Unlike other perissodactyls, the two African species of rhinoceros lack teeth at the front of their mouths, relying instead on their lips to pluck food. Rhinoceros are killed by humans for their horns, which are bought and sold on the black market, and which are used by some cultures for ornamental or traditional medicinal purposes. East Asia, specifically Vietnam, is the largest market for rhino horns. By weight, rhino horns cost as much as gold on the black market. People grind up the horns and then consume them believing the dust has therapeutic properties. The horns are made of keratin, the same type of protein that makes up hair and fingernails. Both African species and the Sumatran rhinoceros have two horns, while the Indian and Javan rhinoceros have a single horn.\n\nElephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Two species are traditionally recognised, the African elephant and the Asian elephant, although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species. Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons. Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb). All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants\' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs. Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They prefer to stay near water. They are considered to be keystone species due to their impact on their environments. Other animals tend to keep their distance from elephants while predators, such as lions, tigers, hyenas, and wild dogs, usually target only young elephants (or \"calves\"). Females (\"cows\") tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The groups are led by an individual known as the matriarch, often the oldest cow. Elephants have a fission\u2013fusion society in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Males (\"bulls\") leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild.\n\nAll information according to www.wikipedia.org\n\nBison vs Grizzly Bear vs Moose vs Elk vs Deer vs Buffalo vs Wolf vs Bull vs Lion vs Tiger vs Elephant vs Giraffe vs Rhino vs Gorilla vs Whale vs Shark vs Panther vs Python vs Anaconda vs Jaguar vs Boar vs Walrus vs Polar Bear vs Hyena vs Warthog vs Hippo vs Wolves vs Wolfpack vs Cobra vs Mongoose vs Alligator vs Yak vs Piranha.

'Discover Scuba Diving Thailand - Programme 4 - Koh Samui, Koh Tao, Chumphon Enjoy a broad overview on diving locations, facilities, accommodations, and further activities for your perfect diving vacation to Thailand on the new multi-lingual DVD. See, where you can meet whale sharks, manta rays, turtles, ghost pipe fishes, or dive into wrecks.\nWe examined the most beautiful dive spots for you (see the Thailand Map for an overview) and took all videos at the original locations ourselves: There is no old stuff. shapeimage_1_link_0\nIn addition, we visited lots of facilities and met instructors and divers, evaluated accommodations, and found other activities interesting for your holidays, that we truly can recommend - we awarded them the Dive Club Thailand Seal.\nBesides the videos from the original locations (in English, German, Russian, Japanese, Finnish, and Swedish), all this information is included in the supplemental Information Booklet (in English) with all the addresses for your direct contact.\nOn this Website, you get an overview of the four programmes the DVD contains (South Thailand, East Thailand, Andaman Sea, and Gulf of Thailand). As you will see, it is made by enthusiastic divers for both experienced divers and those who just want to learn it.\nAdditionally, we offer the contacts and addresses for those who know all these beautiful diving locations in Thailand and enjoyed snorkelling, scuba diving, technical diving , and the enormous variety of marine life in Thailand already.\n\nThe final programme on the DVD takes you to the beautiful islands in the southern Gulf of Thailand. Koh Tao, Koh Samui and Koh Phangan have been visited by tourists for many years and never fail to satisfy ... with powder white sandy beaches and turquoise blue waters.\nEach island has something different to offer ... Koh Tao is more laid back without much development it is the backpackers dream. Koh Samui and Koh Phangan have received a little more investment and developed over recent times but it is still possible to find your own secluded beach.\nWe show you each of the islands and the dive sites which can be found around each. Chumphon is around 520 km south of Bangkok but only 2 hours by boat from Koh Tao and is the eco tourist\'s dream.\nVery little development has been made here and the forests and rivers inland are flowing with flora and fauna. Chumphon has a number of local islands which have very little diving over the years yet, which offer the diver the opportunity to see several marine critters like Sea Horses, Frog Fish and Cleaner Shrimps.\nAs shown in the DVD we think Chumphon and the Islands make excellent destinations for those people who want to learn to dive, with its combination of good visibility and shallower dive sites its the perfect place to gain your confidence.

Modern sharks are classified within the clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii) and are the sister group to the rays.\n\nThere are over 500 species of sharks.  They range in size from the small dwarf lanternshark (Etmopterus perryi), a deep sea species of only 17 centimetres (6.7 in) in length, to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the largest fish in the world, which reaches approximately 12 metres (40 ft) in length.\n\nWATCH ME SWIM WITH A MERMAID AND A WHALE SHARK AT THE SAME TIME\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lOKQwfKKyMQ\n\n\nSharks are found in all seas and are common to depths of 2,000 metres (6,600 ft). They generally do not live in freshwater although there are a few known exceptions, such as the bull shark and the river shark, which can survive and be found in both seawater and freshwater.[ Sharks have a covering of dermal denticles that protects their skin from damage and parasites in addition to improving their fluid dynamics. They have numerous sets of replaceable teeth. [\"Sharks\",\"shark attack\",\"shark attack vr\",\"sharks for kids\",\"wildlife\",\"tail\",\"orangutan\",\"skateboard\"

We have the hammerhead points and Madivaru channel for diving. We will bring you to the great spots where you can find dolphins, schools of hammerhead sharks, Eagle rays, Sting rays, large Manta Rays (our manta season is really Nov- April), Turtles (green and hawksbill), Barracuda, Tuna, Napoleons, School of trevally, Grouper, Morays, Leaf fish, Frog fish, Ghost pipe fish, Ribbon eels, Parrot Fish, Surgeon Fish, Trigger Fish, and much more.

'Experts baffled after giant humpback whale found in Amazon jungle Experts baffled after giant humpback whale found in Amazon jungle\nHumpback Whale Washes Ashore in Amazon River, Baffling Scientists in Brazil\nBrazilian researchers investigating discovery of dead humpback whale in Amazon jungle\n\nExperts are baffled as to how an 11-metre long humpback whale ended up dead in the Amazon jungle.\n\nWhen a flock of vultures were spotted flying above the decomposing mammal on Friday, a group of biologists raced to the scene at the island of Marajo in Brazil\u2019s north, where the rainforest meats the ocean.\n\nAuthorities from the NGO Bicho D\u2019agua said they were stumped as to how the whale, believed to be a 12-month-old calf, ended up so far from its natural habitat in the winter season.\n\nRemarkable images captured by the marine conservationist group show the dead whale splayed out on the forest floor in the middle of a swampy mangrove, some 15 metres from the ocean.\n\nWith no definitive answer as to how it ended up there, the biologists took some samples from the whale before it deteriorated too severely in the hope it may provide some clarification.\n\nThe project\u2019s president Renata Emin speculated that the creature may have been floating close to the shore when abnormally high tides, that have plagued the area in recent weeks, picked it up and threw it inland.\n\n\u201CAlong with this astonishing feat, we are baffled as to what a humpback whale is doing on the north coast of Brazil during February because this is a very unusual occurrence,\u201D he told local media.\n\nHe said given humpback whales usually don\u2019t travel to the north, it\u2019s likely it became separated from its pod during the during the migratory cycle.\n__ PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO MY CHANNEL\n__SUBSCRIBE MY CHANNEL : http:\/\/pesc.pw\/6WF4U\n__HOT news in Vietnam and around the world.\n__http: \/\/pesc.pw\/6WF4U\n__ facebook : https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Do-You-Know\n__ Website : http:\/\/www.doyouknow.com\/\nAny policy violations, community principles, copyright laws please contact us directly via email: thanhhoa02051992@gmail.com [\"do you know\",\"Experts baffled\",\"giant humpback whale\",\"whale\",\"whale found in Amazon jungle\",\"Amazon jungle\",\"Experts baffled after giant humpback whale\",\"Experts baffled after giant humpback whale found in Amazon jungle\",\"shaun evans\",\"a quiet place\",\"dead humpback whale in Amazon jungle\",\"Brazilian researchers investigating\",\"amazon rainforest location\",\"deforestation in the amazon\",\"inghams enterprises\",\"why are rainforests important\",\"amazon animals\",\"humpback whale\",\"whale amazon\"

'Fisherman Catch Baby Whale Shark Fisherman catch baby whale shark. Divers on lunch break hear local fisherman yelling loudly during a large and unexpected catch. Locals and divers ran to see as the fisheman proudly dragged their catch to shore. Upon realizing it was a 4 meter baby whale shark, a diver from Moscow offered to pay the fisherman to release the shark unharmed. The deal was struck and both parties worked together to help the shark along it\'s way. It was happily not seen again.

You\u2019d be amazed every time you caught something, and your parents would act impressed, too, even if it was smaller than your palm. At the time you\u2019d find it hard to believe that there were creatures in the ocean bigger than that. Obviously, now that you\u2019ve grown older, you\u2019re aware of some of the huge beasts that grace our seas. Of course, there\u2019s the blue whale or the great white shark, but have you ever considered some of the lesser-known creatures out there?\n\nWe\u2019ve put together a list of some of the biggest living things you\u2019ll find in the ocean \u2013 although they\u2019re not necessarily all things you would like to catch. For example, you most definitely do not want to come across a Giant Spider Crab while paddling at the shore, although chance would be a fine thing, as they don\u2019t tend to swim to the surface. Or what about the Fin Whale? A far friendlier giant, it\u2019s one you should try and see in your lifetime \u2013 if it doesn\u2019t get hunted into extinction anytime soon.\n\nIf you\u2019re venturing further afield, and happen to be in Antarctica, you might be lucky enough to be greeted by a Southern Elephant Seal. You\u2019ll be surprised to find out why it\u2019s named that, too. Some other interesting beasts in our video include the Lion\u2019s Mane Jellyfish, the Oceanic Manta Ray and the Whale Shark, but you\u2019ll have to watch the video to find out the rest.

'World biggest shark\/whale world bigges shark The whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is a slow-moving filter-feeding carpet shark and the largest known extant fish species. The largest confirmed individual had a length of 12.65 m (41.5 ft) and a weight of about 21.5 t (47,000 lb).[3] Unconfirmed claims of considerably larger individuals, over 14 m (46 ft) long and weighing at least 30 t (66,000 lb), are not uncommon.[citation needed] The whale shark holds many records for sheer size in the animal kingdom, most notably being by far the largest living nonmammalian vertebrate. It is the sole member of the genus Rhincodon and the only extant member of the family Rhincodontidae (called Rhiniodon and Rhinodontidae before 1984), which belongs to the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes. The species originated about 60 million years ago.[4] [\"facts\",\"shark\",\"best of shark tank\",\"2016\",\"shark encounters\",\"shark tank\",\"shark tank best pitch\",\"shark tank best moments\",\"sharks\",\"shark tank best pitch ever\",\"best shark tank deal\",\"kevin o\\u2019leary\",\"robert\",\"barbara\",\"mark cuban\",\"daymond john\",\"@viralyoutube#\",\"lego\",\"psn code generator\",\"free psn codes!\",\"free xbox code\",\"free xbox codes\",\"free psn code\",\"free psn codes\",\"brickfilm\",\"film\",\"brick\",\"lego spiderman\",\"superheroes in real life\",\"superheroes\",\"funny\"

You may encounter a seasonal whale shark with over 40 spotted at Sail Rock in 2013 alone.  Giant moray eels and lion fish have also taken up residency.

'Great pictures of swimming with whale sharks Great pictures of swimming with whale sharks\n-------------------------\nIt may sound surprising to hear that a photographer traveled all the way across the globe to take some photos of fish. But this wasn\'t just any photographer, and these weren\u2019t just any fish. This was world renowned conservation photographer Pete Oxford. And the fish? Whale sharks. Enormous \u2013 the largest fish in the sea, in fact \u2013 and magnificent. Reaching lengths of 40 feet and weighing in at some 20 tons, they are simply massive. While the whale part is a bit of a misnomer \u2013 they really are fish, not mammals \u2013 they are indeed more docile than aggressive. They feed on plankton and other small prey caught in the water that they sieve for food, much in the manner of baleen whales. In one part of the world, they are even seen as good luck charms.

'[unknown] Easy Divers had a PHENOMENAL dive at the Georgia Aquarium!  Whale Sharks, Blacktip reef, Sandbar, Nurse, & Zebra sharks, rays of all shapes and sizes, including massive, majestic Mantas, schools of beautiful fish, Wobbegongs,  and MORE!  We also did a PADI Whale Shark Specialty, which allowed us, under supervision, to get within INCHES of the magnificent Whale Sharks.  We were also treated to a fascinating behind the scenes tour of the aquarium.  Truly a once in a lifetime dive.  This video, which was shot by a GA Aquarium diver, is really beautiful, but it really doesn\'t do the dive justice.

'The Scripting Whale Shark | Slow Moving Filter Feeding The whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is a slow-moving, filter-feeding carpet shark and the largest known extant fish species. The largest confirmed individual had a length of 12.65 m (41.5 ft) and a weight of about 21.5 t (47,000 lb).[8] The whale shark holds many records for size in the animal kingdom, most notably being by far the largest living nonmammalian vertebrate. It is the sole member of the genus Rhincodon and the only extant member of the family Rhincodontidae which belongs to the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes. Before 1984 it was classified as Rhiniodon into Rhinodontidae.

'Breaking News  - Scientists have taken ultrasounds from wild whale sharks Share this article   Share  It\'s the biggest shark in the sea, often found roaming in warm waters around the globe with its huge mouth agape in search of dinner.\u00A0Yet despite its hulking appearance, the whale shark is actually incredible docile and only has tiny, almost useless teeth  Pictured is an ultrasound   No one knows how many whale sharks are left but rough estimates put their numbers somewhere in the tens of thousands worldwide. Pictured is an ultrasound\u00A0   It\'s thanks to its docile nature that scientists have been able to complete ultrasounds and take blood samples from these sharks in the Galapagos   The incredible results allowed them to see and identify reproductive organs, such as the ovaries, and even developing follicles   Researchers led by conservationists from the Galapagos Whale Shark Project looked at whale sharks near Darwin Island, in the far north of the Galapagos Archipelago   This remote volcanic island is one of the few places where huge adult female whale sharks, which are up to 14 m (45 ft) in length, are commonly seen each year  While they are comparable in size to whales, whale sharks are sharks   They typically grow to be bigger than a double-decker bus: between 6 to 16 meters (20 to 52 feet) and more than 20 tons   The gentle giants aren\'t particularly fast when compared to other sharks, but a simple wave of their tail propels them through the water faster than any human could ever swim   \'Almost nothing is known about the reproduction of these giant sharks\', said Jonathan R. Green, the expedition leader and founder of the Galapagos Whale Shark Project   \'After I first saw these huge female whale sharks in the far north Galapagos, I realised that this was a great opportunity to learn more\', said Dr Green   \'We\'ve been able to put together an experienced team to research sharks in this remote area, one of the world\'s most isolated dive sites\', Dr Green said   \'All tags are transmitting well, so we should get great information on where these sharks swim over the months to come\', said Professor Hearn   Kiyomi Murakumo from Okinawa Churashima Foundation, successfully collected blood samples from six adult sharks   \'Sex steroid hormone levels in the blood are an excellent way to monitor reproduction in individual sharks\', Dr Murakumo said   \'This study measured levels of estradiol, progesterone and testosterone of wild, adult female whale sharks for the first time in the world\'   Whale sharks\u00A0feed by scooping huge amounts of tiny plankton and small fish from the water - particularly near the surface and in warm water   They typically grow to be bigger than a double-decker bus: between 6 to 16 meters (20 to 52 feet) and more than 20 tons   As filter feeders, the enormous whale sharks are dangerous only to the plankton, fish eggs and tiny fish they chomp on\nAutoNews- Source:https:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/sciencetech\/article-6319721\/Scientists-taken-ultrasounds-wild-whale-sharks-Galapagos.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490 [\"Scientists\",\"taken\",\"ultrasounds\",\"wild\",\"whale\",\"sharks\",\"Galapagos\",\"AutoNews\",\"breaking news\",\"hot news\",\"sciencetech\"

'5 extinct animals captured in camera and seen in real life! 5 extinct animals captured on camera in real life description: extinction has been a controversial subject since it was suggested by scientists in the 19th century. in the time elapsed since then  the evidence has come to show that extinction might not be so permanent after all. with this said these are 5 extinct animals captured on camera and seen in real life. .... ready?? ... start...!!\\n\\n1. dinosaur in africa while the rest of the animals have lived recently  this animal lived millions of years ago. a tribe in the republic of congo was reportedly captured by a velociraptor in the jungle  which they proudly put on display. while the dinosaurs allegedly became extinct 65 million years ago  some people believe that the small populations continued to survive in the deepest and darkest desert  far from human contact. sometimes it is believed that these possible survivors are the origin of dragons  snakes and other great monsters of human mythology. it may be possible that something undiscovered and unexplained continue to prosper in the 500 million hectares of rainforest in the congo that inspired the story of joseph conrad heart of darkness.\\n\\n2. the whale omura the omura whale is a species of whale recently discovered originally in the years 2000 by a japanese researcher. it was discovered through dna analysis found in the whale bones at the bottom of the ocean in the years 90. it was believed that the whale  which had hitherto been undiscovered  was extinguished. it was later discovered that the bones belonged to a dwarf fin or pygmy whale that was rarely seen across asia.\\n\\n3. mammoth wooly mammoth wooly is believed to have been hunted to extinction by man during the ice age. while their relatives survived to become a modern asian elephant  mammoths are theorized to have been dead 10 000 years ago. some have theorized that the woolly mammoths continued to live and existed in cold regions where they were safe from humans and warmer temperatures. they believe that the preserved and mummified corpses of mammoths found in these areas could be evidence of this  and sightings of mammoths have been reported in the wild. this video captures one of those sightings like a wooly mammoth allegedly tries to cross a frozen river in a forest in siberia.\\n\\n4. tasmanian tiger the tasmanian tiger was a carnivorous marsupial that emigrateded australia before it died. it is also known as the wolf tasmano  despite having no relationship with wolves or tigers  due to its appearance of dog and tiger-striped. the tasmanian tigers were already rare before the british settlers arrived  and they believed they had died out on the island of australia  although the species continued to live on the island of tasmania from which it took its name. due to a combination of excessive hunting and habitat invasion  this creature would have been extinguished in the 1990s  when the last wild tasmanian tiger was killed in 1930. on the other hand. there have always been rumors about this subject.. and this video captures a tasmanian tiger in australia. go...\\n\\n5. megalodon the myths about big fish as sea monsters are universal to human conditions. the best known may be the legend of the leviathan  an ancient and giant fish or whale who ate the biblical figure job. although traditionally it was believed that the leviathan had been a whale  the discovery of the ancient and supposedly extinct megalodon shark led people to believe that perhaps the inspiration for leviathan had originally been a giant shark. while it is believed that the megalodonios are extinct  only 5% of the ocean has been explored and day-to-day biologists discover new species of creatures and even rediscover species that were previously considered extinct. it is not impossible that an evolutionary return to the megalodon can continue to exist. this giant shark was captured by the japanese marine biologists in 2016 background music: kevin macleod-kevin macleod music of the end: for copyright subjects  do not hesitate to send me an email here: officialamerikano@hotmail.com _____ ______ _____... __________.... __________ thank you very much for watching this video................. give like if you liked this video [\\animals\\  \\creatures\\  \\strangers\\  \\real life\\  \\captured in camera\\  \\captured in video\\  \\captured in camara\\  \\extinct animals\\  \\that could revive\\  \\in camera\\  \\viral\\  \\real\\  \\strange animals\\  \\captured\\  \\monsters\\  \\megalodon\\  \\strangers animals \\ \\ extinction \\ \\ extinct animals \\ \\ live animals \\ \\ extinct creatures \\ \\ captured in camera \\ \\ captured in video \\ \\ captured \\ \\ extinct animals that could remain alive \\ \\ captured \\ \\ extinct \\ \\ animals found alive \\ \\ captured \\

'whale sharks of oslob whale shark dive at oslob.  obviously a bit of a controversial place to dive  its basically a fish tank - i tried my best to crop out the approx. 100 snorkellers from the video! didnt really know the background before we went (ie local fishermen feed the sharks -  allegedly this stops them being caught in nets  which the fishermen historically put across the straight  which is a migration route.  however  the sharks are clearly now resident and dont migrate at all  does the huge amount of revenue created go back into conservation? allegedly  yes.  would i go back - no.  but there is a part of me that thinks this is no difference to feeding migratory birds in the park...)

'Sizing Up Sharks, the Lords of the Sea - Megalodon compared to a diver Check out this website:\n\nSharks range in size from the largest fish on the planet to the length of your palm. See how you compare to some of these vulnerable predators that are so crucial to the ocean\'s health.\n\nWhale shark\nThis slow-moving, filter-feeding shark is the largest known fish species alive.\n\nGreat hammerhead shark\nA wide head helps these sharks scan for and pin down rays and other prey.\n\nGreat white shark\nThis legendary predator lives in coastal surface waters worldwide. Its serrated teeth may be a link to extinct ancestors.\n\nGreenland shark\nScientists suspect that this slow-growing Arctic species can live up to a hundred years.\n\nTiger shark\nThis shark is named for its distinct black stripes, which fade in adulthood.\n\nBluntnose sixgill shark\nSharks typically have five gills, but this primitive species has six. Most related species are extinct.\n\nOceanic whitetip shark\nDue to high demand for shark fin soup, these large-finned sharks are in decline.\n\nAngel shark\nWith flat bodies and broad pectoral fins, angel sharks resemble rays and skates.\n\nJapanese sawshark\nIts long, toothy snout helps it sift sand for prey but can get snared in gill nets.\n\nPortuguese dogfish\nThese bottom-feeders live in darkness, at depths greater than all other sharks.\n\nHorn shark\nThis solitary shark uses its horned head to crack open mollusks and crustaceans.\n\nDwarf lanternshark\nBioluminescent organs make these tiny sharks glow in the dark, attracting prey.\n\nMegalodon\nA seven-inch fossil tooth of this extinct shark was used to project the scale of its massive body, which would have included jaws more than six feet wide.\n\nSubscribe & More Videos: https:\/\/goo.gl\/QP62Qo\nThank for watching, Please Like Share And SUBSCRIBE!!!\n#greenlandshark, #nationalgeographic [\"Greenland shark\",\"national geographic\",\"great white shark\",\"Tiger shark\",\"Great hammerhead shark\",\"megalodon\",\"education\",\"Angel shark\",\"Whale shark\",\"sharks size\",\"sharks\"
